29/11/22, 17:58 - Sangmesh: “Faith is different from belief. Faith is rooted in experience. Belief is provisional faith.

“Belief is necessary in the beginning. Without it, people wouldn’t trouble to seek God. Mere belief, however, is not enough. When people remain satisfied with their beliefs, their religion becomes dogmatic, and therefore closed to further growth.

“I say, make spiritual practice, not belief, your ‘dogma.’ Don’t remain satisfied even with regular meditation, until you have found God.”
29/11/22, 17:58 - Sangmesh: Haha🤣
29/11/22, 18:07 - Vinay Gowda: For to experience the faith in all its entirety you should try shivanga and trek velliangiri hills

02/12/22, 07:43 - Sangmesh: The mind is only thoughts. Of all, the thought ‘I’ alone is the root. That which is called the mind is ‘I’.

When one investigates within whence one rises as ‘I’, ‘I’ will bow its head in shame [and die]. This is ‘jñāna-vicāra’ (investigation of knowledge or awareness).

In the place where ‘I’ merges, the one appears spontaneously as ‘I am I’. That itself is ‘pūrṇa’ (the limitless, perfectly whole existence).

That is always the essential meaning of the word ‘I’, because we never are nonexistent, not even in [dreamless] sleep which is devoid of ‘I’.

She does Giri Pradakshina every day morning. The street vendors consider themselves blessed of she stops by and takes anything from them. 

She very rarely accepts anything from anyone. Even if she does, she simply throws them away be it as precious as anything. Such is her Vyragya.

21/12/22, 20:20 - Vinay Gowda: Hey! I loved this blog that I found on Sadhguru App. Thought you might find it interesting and useful, too.

21/12/22, 20:38 - Vilas: *XBB variant*

 Let's pay attention to the following information:

 Everyone is advised to wear a mask because the new variant of the COVID-Omicron XBB coronavirus is different, deadly and not easy to detect correctly.

 The symptoms of the new virus COVID-Omicron XBB are the following:

     1. There is no cough.
     2. There is no fever.

   There will only be a limited number of these others:

     3. Joint pain.
     4. Headache.
     5. Pain in the neck.
     6. Upper back pain.
     7. Pneumonia.
     8. There is usually no appetite.


 COVID-Omicron XBB is 5 times more virulent than the Delta variant and has a higher mortality rate than it.

 It takes less time for the condition to reach extreme severity and sometimes there are no obvious symptoms.

 Let's be more careful!

 This strain of the virus is not found in the nasopharyngeal region and directly affects the lungs for a relatively short period of time.

 Several patients diagnosed with Covid-Omicron XBB were classified as afebrile and pain free, but x-rays showed mild chest pneumonia.

 Nasal swab tests are often negative for Covid-Omicron XBB, and cases of false negative nasopharyngeal tests are increasing.

 This means that the virus can spread in the community and directly infect the lungs, causing viral pneumonia, which in turn causes acute respiratory distress.

 This explains why the Covid-Omicron XBB has become something very contagious, highly virulent and lethal.

 Caution, avoid crowded places, keep a distance of 1.5 m even in open spaces, wear a double-layer mask, wear a suitable mask, wash hands frequently, even if everyone is asymptomatic (no coughing or sneezing).

 This wave of Covid-Omicron XBB is deadlier than the first wave of Covid-19.  So we have to be very careful and take several reinforced precautions against the coronavirus.

 Maintain vigilant communication with your friends and family.

 Do not keep this information to yourself, share it with other family members and friends.

22/12/22, 21:28 - Meghanand: <Media omitted>
22/12/22, 21:33 - Vinay Gowda: Just as the squeezing of the scriptures didn't work. Similarly one has to make his body mind to attain to certain state. So sadhana is the way

#yogasehihoga
22/12/22, 21:46 - Vinod: Is that sadana is not from scriptures?
22/12/22, 21:47 - Vinay Gowda: Which sadhana are you talking about
22/12/22, 21:47 - Vinod: Which u mentioned here😅
22/12/22, 21:48 - Vinay Gowda: There are 2 kinds of people who  have bhagavadgita
22/12/22, 21:49 - Vinay Gowda: One keeps in Pooja space and do daily Pooja. The other practices it rather try to imbibe in his life in whatever way possible
22/12/22, 21:53 - Vinod: Oh ok
22/12/22, 21:54 - Meghanand: And there is 3 kinds 
One who keeps in Pooja space
Another do real practice
3 kind one who act like real practicenor
22/12/22, 21:57 - Vinay Gowda: There could only be 2 kinds . Anymore than that is a mere combination of the above two
22/12/22, 22:53 - Vinay Gowda: https://youtu.be/Nhd8IFy4R6k
22/12/22, 22:53 - Vinay Gowda: Vinod gear up now
22/12/22, 22:57 - Vinod: Yaaa🧟‍♂️🔥🔥🔥🔥
23/12/22, 09:58 - Vinay Gowda: Just as the squeezing out scriptures nothing came out. Similarly right alignment of planets itself will not end in results. You have to work it out

Whole family is in diffrnrnt level!!
24/12/22, 11:21 - Vinay Gowda: Success in the materialistic world will not give fulfillment to a human being. If you have gone through biographies of Einstein, Steve jobes, Napoleon. They are successful to the world but they die with many unfulfilled desires. There is no end to this materialistic world.

So in is the only way out.

 🍃 *Vaikuntha is a metaphor for mukti, or liberation.*🍂

Vaikuntha Ekadashi is considered the most important ekadashi of the year. Although observing a fast during every ekadashi is conducive to our digestive system👍🏻, and does wonders for our overall wellbeing, observing a full-day fast on this ekadashi is of great spiritual significance. 😌

*Are you fasting this Vaikuntha Ekadashi❓*

03/01/23, 19:00 - Vinay Gowda: Vedanta
03/01/23, 19:02 - Meghanand: Anna hosa mane kambana check made sigabadu
03/01/23, 19:17 - Vinay Gowda: One day Gunda went to Vedanta philosophy class after that he was very clear about everything. He went to restaurant ate fully and then walking back without giving money. He told there is nothing as you and me , nothing as taking and giving everything is god everything is Maya. Restaurant ppl couldn't argue with him they took him to court. The judge after some enquiry asked police to give 10 lashes on to his back . 

After every lash judge used to say there is nothing as giving and taking everything is god everything is Maya. Finally after 10 lashes Gunda came to his senses and all Vedanta had come down by then and ready to pay back his bill
03/01/23, 19:19 - Vinay Gowda: This is what most of them have become read titbits of vedanta and go on everywhere spreading this message.
03/01/23, 19:25 - Vinay Gowda: Krishna's, Shankaracharya's yogic practices need to be revived not only there philosophy
03/01/23, 19:26 - Meghanand: I think he went restaurant which is there in Isha foundation,may be he thought it's ashram and they will provide free foods , after eating he realised it's not ashram
03/01/23, 19:26 - Vinay Gowda: God is not in isha foundation?
03/01/23, 19:27 - Vinay Gowda: U so called santana Dharma followers ppl want to keep Indian spirituality to small Hut?
03/01/23, 19:27 - Meghanand: I don't agree with Shankar 's
03/01/23, 19:28 - Meghanand: We want true spiritual knowledge but right now society must revived so we are supporting Isha and art of living
03/01/23, 19:29 - Vinay Gowda: Rama, Krishna and Janaka were not only kings they were also practicing some sadhanas along with it.
03/01/23, 19:30 - Meghanand: Anna stop madana sakkh
03/01/23, 19:30 - Vinay Gowda: Bharat had rich spiritual past
03/01/23, 19:30 - Meghanand: Sakku
03/01/23, 19:33 - Meghanand: @919620289505 please throw some light on this debate.....
03/01/23, 19:33 - Vinay Gowda: Adhichunchungiri mutt, yediyur mutt and few other mutts are all funded by political parties. Hence when it comes to reservation or doing election rally these guys will come and support them openly. That's not the case with Isha
03/01/23, 21:08 - Vinay Gowda: Christian missionaries on one hand they are converting the lower class for free education and on other hand they bought up the concept of "Sanatana Dharma", telling the youths of Bharat, that Yogi's look like this guru's look like this and make our mindset to go looking for people who look like Gandhi. They fooled us in the pre independence now in post independence same tactics going on.

If our prime minister wears a suit they start calling him a "corporate politician ". Do indians have to wear small loin cloth only?
03/01/23, 21:26 - Vinod: Then who will u agreed with?
03/01/23, 21:26 - Vinod: In that case is Ramana and ramakrishna paramahamasa is the same, is that the mindset made by Christian missionaries
03/01/23, 21:33 - Meghanand: I agree with iskcon must be revived, Shankar yogic practices are the best so i don't agree
03/01/23, 21:33 - Vinay Gowda: This is how you guys plan. When Ramana or ramakrishna was living at that time they were banded has mental asylum people. Show me a ramakrishna in the current time can you?
03/01/23, 21:34 - Vinay Gowda: You guys always take us to past or ask us wait for future but life happens only in present
03/01/23, 21:35 - Vinod: Then there is no necessity of past then
03/01/23, 21:36 - Vinay Gowda: Then why you compare the contemporary ones with that of past past and ask our youths don't go behind this man see ramakrishna he is th real guru see how simple he was and brainwash our youths
03/01/23, 21:36 - Vinod: What r u referring in iskon??? Which iskon has to revived??
03/01/23, 21:37 - Meghanand: Prabhupada 's iskcon
03/01/23, 21:38 - Vinod: No i am just correcting myself i am just asking and brain wash r u aware what u r saying?
03/01/23, 21:38 - Vinod: What prapbhupada iskon?
03/01/23, 21:39 - Meghanand: Need to revived is some yogic  practice
03/01/23, 21:39 - Vinay Gowda: You guys are so infuriated about yogic sciences because this is acting has a master stroke to all your philosophy. Because yoga works just as science
03/01/23, 21:39 - Vinod: For which philosophy it is giving stroke ?
03/01/23, 21:40 - Vinod: Can u explain me
03/01/23, 21:40 - Vinay Gowda: For your santana Dharma concept
03/01/23, 21:40 - Vinod: What yogic practice u r going to revive
03/01/23, 21:41 - Vinod: Oh then there r many sanatana darma in india
03/01/23, 21:41 - Vinay Gowda: You call Bharat as bharatmata but stop ladies doing Pooja inside temple.

 are you aware of Gargi Maithreyi?
03/01/23, 21:41 - Vinod: That's great
03/01/23, 21:41 - Meghanand: They are using only bhakti yoga and other forms of shud be included
03/01/23, 21:42 - Vinod: Then explain me what is bhakti yoga? Educate me
03/01/23, 21:43 - Vinay Gowda: Bhakti means ultimate dissolution. There should not be any I or the ego
03/01/23, 21:43 - Vinod: Who are they
03/01/23, 21:44 - Vinay Gowda: They are the ancient women during the Vedic period who participated in the debates of sabha and samiti
03/01/23, 21:44 - Vinay Gowda: They were respected as equals to men
03/01/23, 21:45 - Vinod: R they live in past or present ?
03/01/23, 21:45 - Vinod: Did u seen them through u r eyes
03/01/23, 21:45 - Vinay Gowda: They died long back
03/01/23, 21:46 - Vinod: Then those who died in the past why u r taking as example
03/01/23, 21:46 - Vinod: Can u show me any one now?

03/01/23, 21:46 - Vinay Gowda: Can you see the gravity
03/01/23, 21:47 - Vinod: Then referring Ramana and ramakrishna what is the problem
03/01/23, 21:47 - Vinay Gowda: U refer to them negatively by pulling someone else statures down
03/01/23, 21:48 - Vinod: What made u think i taken reference as negativity in them
03/01/23, 21:48 - Vinod: And whose statures i am taking down
03/01/23, 21:49 - Vinay Gowda: According to you Sadhguru should not ride on bike he should ride on TVS 50 scooter
03/01/23, 21:49 - Vinod: Did i mentioned that who told i was referring to that
03/01/23, 21:51 - Vinay Gowda: Your trying to divide this culture by imposing western blanket of commonalities this culture doesn't have single god or refer to one single scripture .
03/01/23, 21:51 - Vinod: Let Sadhguru what ever he wants what's the issue in that. he as that capability .
03/01/23, 21:53 - Vinod: Yes we know that from before only and one more thing all the gods are ultimately refer to null.
03/01/23, 21:53 - Vinay Gowda: Whether it's null or full ur refering to same thing
03/01/23, 21:54 - Vinod: No
03/01/23, 21:55 - Vinay Gowda: Gold is everywhere -
No value to gold

Gold is nowhere -
No value to gold
03/01/23, 21:56 - Vinod: But gold can get through earth and we can manifest which ever the shape we need
03/01/23, 21:56 - Vinay Gowda: I am saying with reference to whole universe
03/01/23, 21:57 - Vinod: I am saying with reference to nothing.
03/01/23, 21:57 - Vinay Gowda: How can you keep reference as nothing?
03/01/23, 21:58 - Vinay Gowda: Have you gone through physics or chemistry
03/01/23, 21:58 - Vinay Gowda: 1 kg is being measured with respect to a  standard weight that is in the laboratory of some institute
03/01/23, 21:59 - Vinod: Then how can u take reference the whole universe ,even 1% of the earth is not known

03/01/23, 22:20 - Sangmesh: From 6th i wil start my practise.
03/01/23, 22:20 - Meghanand: ಮನೋ ಬುಧ್ಯಹಂಕಾರ ಚಿತ್ತಾನಿ ನಾಹಂ
ನ ಚ ಶ್ರೋತ್ರ ಜಿಹ್ವೇ ನ ಚ ಘ್ರಾಣನೇತ್ರೇ ।
ನ ಚ ವ್ಯೋಮ ಭೂಮಿರ್-ನ ತೇಜೋ ನ ವಾಯುಃ
ಚಿದಾನಂದ ರೂಪಃ ಶಿವೋಽಹಂ ಶಿವೋಽಹಮ್
03/01/23, 22:21 - Vinay Gowda: When you have to pull on a debate on someone you have to take stance that means you have to attach yourself to something and try protecting and tackling the opponent
03/01/23, 22:21 - Sangmesh: Cut and paste from google we wont like this
03/01/23, 22:22 - Vinay Gowda: That is what I am telling stop debating start practicing
03/01/23, 22:22 - Meghanand: I listen to every guru but i follow only the true essence
03/01/23, 22:22 - Vinod: Sorry yar i am still in starting stage so i am deciding with whom i need to attach
03/01/23, 22:22 - Vinay Gowda: Do this chant on sandhyakalas do it for one week and let me know the experience
03/01/23, 22:22 - Vinod: Ok my time is up 😴😴
03/01/23, 22:23 - Vinay Gowda: Are you waking up at Brahm muhurat?
03/01/23, 22:26 - Meghanand: <Media omitted>
03/01/23, 22:29 - Vinay Gowda: These things gives you temporary conclusion or relief.
03/01/23, 22:30 - Vinay Gowda: Real transformation need to happen. Pattern of thought, your face, your voice, your presence must bring an exhilarating effect on people. Without even uttering a word people should feel you, respond to you
03/01/23, 22:38 - Meghanand: The unreal never comes into existence and real never goes out of existence ,those who are truly wise they have understood this two.
03/01/23, 22:43 - Vinay Gowda: Who cares if one understands this or not?

If I go to a IT company interview. In the interview i tell them #yogasehihoga then they will give nice slap and show me the exit door
04/01/23, 06:20 - Vinod: I my thought it's not necessarily, your presence not must may bring an exhilarating effect on people.for example if i am wrong correct me you said that once some people may experience or may not something anything in front of dyanalinga
04/01/23, 06:20 - Vinod: As I know dyanalinga is one the most powerful linga ,as Sadhguru said it is same as living being then that as to make exhilarating effect on all but it not right.
04/01/23, 06:20 - Vinod: That means i am not doubting the dyanalinga i am doubting people let me put my words like this .
04/01/23, 06:20 - Vinod: Usually people will always concentrate on transmitting side,on transmitting side it has to be so clear and high level of frequency it should be
04/01/23, 06:20 - Vinod: But they merely bother about receiving side, even receiving side as to be very good right to get what all the things sent by transmitting side should receive for 100 %
04/01/23, 06:20 - Vinod: So if receiving side is good then only they can experience the exhilarating effect from the source not for all.
04/01/23, 06:20 - Vinod: Correct me if i am wrong 🙏
04/01/23, 06:20 - Vinod: But i again i am telling u i am not doubting dyanalinga because even i have experienced something so i am doubting receiving end it should good as that 🙏
04/01/23, 06:20 - Vinod: Shiva 🙏🙏🙏
04/01/23, 06:22 - Vinod: I didn't get it Explain me what ur saying in simple words
04/01/23, 06:49 - Vinay Gowda: So your bringing Plato's myth of metals that is not all human being are born in same quality. That is why you must do yoga. Inorder to be receptive
04/01/23, 07:14 - Vinod: 😂😂
04/01/23, 07:16 - Vinod: See again u r referring past😅😂
04/01/23, 07:19 - Vinod: Ok i am just giving advise not a opinion both of u ,may agree with it or may not choice is u r
04/01/23, 07:19 - Vinod: Ur's
04/01/23, 07:23 - Vinod: See what i understood is for time to time many beautiful souls came and they had discovered the things which will be helpful for that mankind ,but remember they did not invented the things because as I know there is nothing is there to invent in this process but there is only to discover
04/01/23, 07:24 - Vinod: As of Isha they r doing beautiful job Sadhguru had discovered very special tool and practices to this mankind it's a boon for this generation yes i completely agree with this but that doesn't mean it will last for ever
04/01/23, 07:26 - Vinod: Because time to time the practices are modified according to that generation for ex patanjali invented the yoga if we considered later it modified taking reference as that many modified version of yoga came and they r working beautifully for many members
04/01/23, 07:28 - Vinod: So that doesn't mean that patanjali yoga is waste as of same vendanta is also similar to that it might work fully for those generation but even few things are will work now
04/01/23, 07:29 - Vinod: So u both r blessed souls u got chance to explore the new in that ,for that to happen u need to deep dive throught u might get new dimensions in that
04/01/23, 07:33 - Vinod: Vinay u have to keep little bit of pride that u r practicing Isha because u can say easily i am practicing Isha beacuse Isha only declared right they giving yogic sciences for the world that means u r practicing yogic science itself.so deep dive through that even in future by taking reference of past experience of sadguru teachings u might be able to unlock the new dimensions with in that practices and u can give that gift to mankind and i think that is the gurudakshine for sadhuguru i hope
04/01/23, 07:35 - Vinod: Meghanand by not experiencing the fullest of vendanta u can't say it's works completely so even u just dive in to that completely check what are the dimensions r there explore it and give that knowledge to others that will make u more stable
04/01/23, 07:36 - Vinod: By only knowing 1% it will help u with that
04/01/23, 07:36 - Vinod: At last anything in this world will not last for ever
04/01/23, 07:38 - Vinod: It as to be changed and modified good example is now siddheshwar Swami see how he gone the Upanishads and made   them understand for this generation that is real beauty of him that's where he stands different from others
04/01/23, 07:39 - Vinod: So explore the fullest of ur practices and give a boon for this mankind
04/01/23, 07:40 - Sangmesh: ಸತ್ಯ ಯಾವ್ದು ಅಂಥ ನಾವು ತಿಳ್ಕೊಬೇಕು ನಾವು ನೋಡಿರೋ ಸತ್ಯನಾ ಬೇರೆ ಅವ್ರ್ಗೆ ಹೇಳಿ ಅರ್ಥ ಮಾಡ್ಸ್ಕೊಕೆ ಹೋಗ್ಬಾರ್ದು. ಧರ್ಮದ ವಿಚಾರದಲ್ಲಿ ತರ್ಕ ಅನಗತ್ಯ.
04/01/23, 07:40 - Vinod: Because ur the blessed soul u got a chance of it not like me 😅
04/01/23, 07:41 - Vinod: By sending this type of msg it won't let u anything remember that
04/01/23, 07:41 - Sangmesh: This is u tube's knowledge
04/01/23, 07:42 - Vinod: So at last vinay and meghanand   correct me if anything is wrong from myside because i am merely a human being i do lots of mistakes 🙏🙏🙏
04/01/23, 07:44 - Vinod: After this please create new what's group with new name of us dissolve this group

04/01/23, 08:29 - Vinay Gowda: One day an old egret sitting on a Bull told there used to be a day i went onto top of the tree but now i can't even fly higher. So the bull said just eat my shit it will give you strength. Egret hesitatingly ate the shit and slowly day by day started to fly higher. 

One day finally it reached top of the tree and made loud sound in full Joy. A old farmer sitting on a rocking chair pulled out a gun and shot the egret!

Moral of the story is sometimes even a Bull shit can make you feel above everything but it will not last forever.
04/01/23, 08:35 - Vinod: Yes exactly shit could be anything😅
04/01/23, 08:36 - Vinay Gowda: When a person leaves , his teachings exemplifies, his followers will increase but if this happens much before his death then it would be even better
04/01/23, 08:37 - Vinod: It's amazing in your story the bull could talk😎
04/01/23, 08:37 - Vinay Gowda: After puneet Rajkumar dies his photo is there every corner of the villages, houses, towns etc
04/01/23, 08:38 - Vinod: I hope let it happens😄

04/01/23, 08:39 - Vinod: Yes that's what i am saying
04/01/23, 08:39 - Vinay Gowda: So don't assume only raghavendra, Sai Baba are the real guru's
04/01/23, 08:40 - Vinod: Who assumes that ,not only them  still many r there but they stand in their own way😄

04/01/23, 12:36 - Vinay Gowda: That is Karma yoga
04/01/23, 12:36 - Vinay Gowda: That also comes in sadhana
04/01/23, 12:37 - Vinay Gowda: Don't think spiritual practices means chanting some mantra 108 times. Doing only morning and evening yoga rest all the day doing something else. Sadhana means to be in action in action and inaction in action.
04/01/23, 12:47 - Vinay Gowda: <Media omitted>
04/01/23, 13:07 - Vilas: 🙏💐
04/01/23, 14:20 - Vilas: But work with full involvement or with devotion can be said as karma yoga than just doing work na

Donot stop for anything morning and evening bathing must happen. You may tend to skip evening bath because you come home by 8:30pm. So i am throwing light on this.


Whether Sadhguru punishes or not  Shani will definitely punish you 🥲

09/01/23, 15:59 - Vinay Gowda: Namaskaram Shiva,

The process of biksha is not only about collection of money. It's a process of dissolving your ego. When one stands without the upper cloth and beg among people naturally your identity shifts and when any person gives you a biksha the way you see him/ her and bow down to that unknown person, can  bring enormous changes within you.

09/01/23, 20:42 - Vinay Gowda: This has nothing to do with the word Krishna. When a singer reaches her highest pitch or intensity, she in  some whay losses herself and become available to the devine.

Whether it is krishna or Yesu all are the Yogi's of the past who challenged the social structure of that time.
 Now the time has come to unite the  humanity. Vasudaiva kutumbakam ( Maha upanishad)

12/01/23, 12:28 - Vilas: Nooo
12/01/23, 13:05 - Vinay Gowda: As a spiritual seeker one can get realised under a bodhi tree or Kaali or mahadev or Krishna or any where . One can feel Bhairavi but one cannot feel anything in dhyanlinga. 

So a spiritual infrastructure must be treated as means to an end but not an end in itself.
12/01/23, 13:50 - Vilas: 🙏💐
12/01/23, 13:52 - Vilas: He even challenged Bhairavi yantra of isha is wrong in geometry...

I stopped posting for sometime as I needed break from thought word world and I don't want to be a drug dealer of words to my friends.😂

I shared many methods and approaches with you about connecting to live life.

All of  those were about using thought and technique to persuade you out of the addictive thinking and experience real juice so that your addictions of thought drop and you get hooked to the real feel of life. This is what trust is not a philosophical concept but a taste of live vibration of life.

Why would you need a photograph of your beloved when you are holding him or her in your arms?

To balance the process of becoming alive one more method I would like to share as a way to give whole organic structure to the process.
It is a methodless method.
It can be like devotion or it can be purest meditation way.
It is a way to break Addiction to to thoughts. 
This way I would name, 

To be with. 

 Meaning let come, let go. 

Method

Sit facing the empty blank wall eyes open and looking at empty wall.

Do nothing, no technique of any kind. Because doing is a thought game to feel you exist as doer or ego.
Whatever thoughts, sounds, emotions come just be with them and just watch out for not getting engaged and go into speaking, doing or thinking but instead let them come and go.
You just keep staring at the wall, watch the drama of being you and many stories from your life history will appear but accept, don't interfere and don't analyse. Here you will learn the feel of let go which means let come let go.

No resistance to any thought or feeling, feel your resistance fear let it play out.

You will notice again and again your mind will want to jump in claim it's control but watch that game, do nothing at all.

 If a painful memory is there do nothing just be with it don't operate on it.

This way you are giving your mind wisdom a space to organise itself by playing out the repressed thoughts memories etc. So once your mind plays out the trapped energies thoughts start to get settled then real wisdom energy of mind will start to surface like a clean mirror.

This is also a deep devotion way just to be with in this moment with life with yourself as you will sit with your beloved life just feeling and listening.

As Beatles famous song
Let it be.

Don't push don't withdraw or ignore. As you look at the waves of the river rising and falling.
You may taste the feel of acceptance the juice of it which means to be with things as they are.

Remember whatsoever happens don't say oh I got trapped in thoughts or I an distracted, let that be, create no futhur mind game just realise and do nothing.

This meditation is highest form of meditation devoped in humanity by zen Buddhism as an improvisation on vippasana meditation in which you focus on breath but zen Buddhism was combination of Buddhist and Taoist philosophy which is based into water method of doing nothing but accepting and becoming the moment.

When you are moved by thoughts and memories you become their slave but when you do nothing let them throw tantrum without saying you have become master. 

So claim your mastery by relaxing sitting facing blank wall open eyes, staring and do nothing about mind thoughts, let things come and let them go.

Mantra for this practise to remember. 
Good news is nothing stays 
Bad news is nothing stays
 
Reason for open eyes is that with closed eyes you fall into dream world of thoughts with open eyes you stay aware of thought as thought not reality. 

This practise will give you a very powerful base to deal with our all issues which arises because of our attachment to compulsive thoughts and reactions.

There is a famous haiku by Basho a zen master and poet. 

Sitting silently doing nothing. 
Spring comes and grass grows by itself. 

🙏🙏🙏

12/09/23, 21:11 - Vinay Gowda: Different perspectives to life
12/09/23, 21:35 - Vinay Gowda: I would like to share two similar incidents that happened on my first Sannidhi Pooja.

During my first Sannidhi Pooja in a new rented home, though I had invited a few of them but later due to some reason I cancelled everyone. Somehow the Pooja finally happened on the same day and to my surprise one couple knocked on the door just during the Pooja. After finishing the Pooja I got up and happily served them with whatever I had.

In a similar fashion this Sunday in my first sannidhi Pooja in our new home, just during the Pooja one couple had come this time too! To my surprise he was our mestri who had built our house, he had come along with his wife, who follows Sadhguru.

On that day I didn't have the interest to do Pooja since I was tired of house shifting but things just took a turn, I was not there at all it was just happening by itself. I was just seeing myself going here and there for Pooja preparation in my new home.

These two incidents showed me how after Sannidhi came to our home. Our house or sannidhi does not just belong to us but for all 🙏🏻🌼 <This message was edited>

15/09/23, 17:12 - Vinay Gowda: “In another 35-40 years’ time when over 70% of the population has no religion, either everybody will be a drug addict or an alcoholic or they will be a meditator.

It's our responsibility to see they turn inward, not get destroyed with chemicals.

So this is the responsibility we have as an organization and as individuals, because this is a great moment in history, that humanity could slide away or it could rise.

And with the kind of technological platforms we have, we can affect that change that people will rise in a major way.

3 billion people if they start closing their eyes for 15 minutes a day, humanity will rise. Believe me, this is all it takes.

We should make it happen.”

17/09/23, 07:12 - Vinay Gowda: Over two decades ago, sitting with my guru one day, I asked him, "How do you tell the difference between an old soul and a young soul?" His response was concise but infinitely clear: "By how they react to life’s experiences."

A younger soul may react poorly to a situation, as he is less able to control his awareness in his mind. A mature soul, who has worked on herself consistently over many lifetimes, will respond more positively to an experience because she has better control over her awareness.

For example, if someone said to a young soul, "Your dress looks ugly!", the young soul may react in an uncontrollable way and respond with, "Well, you dress like a tramp!" An older soul may respond with, "Well, you’ve given me the perfect reason to go shopping. Thank you!"

So, if I can accept myself for where I am in my evolution, then I can accept others for where they are in their evolution. And accepting does not mean approving; it just means acknowledging where one is in their unfoldment. And based on where they are, that is how they will react to life’s experiences. If those reactions are poor, then it behooves us to lovingly and compassionately guide and steer them in the right direction… should they be open to it.

17/09/23, 15:22 - Vinay Gowda: MODI.....nothing political about it.....

There are several reasons to be Narendra Modi's admirer and supporter (independent of his political power and chosen goals)
1.You can never see this leader in shabby clothes or improper hair style or confused state of mind.
2.His body language is commanding, his gait is manly.
3. He resembles a saint in saffron, a soldier in military attire and a divine prince in normal daily wear.
 4.Patriotism is his breath and discipline is in his blood.
5. In whosoever world leader's company he is,  his talent dominates, others appear less talented.
6.Several apparently impossible election promises were fulfilled, we have never seen of any other leader in the past
7.Though he is in nation's higher hieararchy, he never favours his family. Could never see siblings around him, never ever.
8. He never avails any holidday.
9. He has never fallen sick. None has seen him with woollen shawl over his head or neck.
10. He knows how much to talk and when  to keep quiet.
11. Being so busy, none has seen him exhausted. Sense of humour is excellent.
12.His speech is sharp and incomparable. Fluency of his language, clarity of thought, articulation in speech all augur well for the country.
13.He is never afraid of the gimmicks and challenges of political foes.
14.He does not waste his time answering the foolishness of opponents. Yet he is wholly committed to his duty with acumen.
15. He is a fusion of the three virtues - health, tradition and honesty.
16.Not only his decisions but also his shrewedness, timing and dedication are noteworthy.
17. His grandeur resembles a holy symbol of Hindu culture.
18. His powerful eyes are capable of making him a hypnotist.
19. This man has no confusion, fear or selfishness.
20.Lastly even at 70, this man works 15 to 20 hours a day. We have not seen him yawning.
IF YOU FEEL COMMITTED TO THIS WRITING,
IF YOU REALISE YOUR PM IS DISCHARGING HIS DUTIES PERFECTLY,
YOU MAY FORWARD THIS TO
- YOUR WELL-WISHERS❤️

Way to discover your dharma meaning your individuality and purpose in life.
Way to overcome the feeling of being a alien and misfit in this world.
Remember for many of you answer does not exist into where your ego mind is seeking the answer. Because ego mind does not seek answers but seeks comfort and affirmation  for its toxic games of shadows.

Many of you chose intense suffering and being born in this time of tyranny and enslavement of human mind because you are going to be the living examples and inspiration for others in this dark times.

Why you chose this I won't explain that is for you to discover.

Now more practical things first and foremost is to discovery of your True individuality and purpose is not eradication of ego just a immature spiritual fantasy arising out of misunderstanding of purpose of creation in forming of ego.
 Path is of merging the ego with your higher Self. 

There is no eradication of suffering either but you are supposed to learn to be mind alchemist which is how to transform your suffering and disaster into an opportunity and inspiration, using darkness as soil to sprout your seeds of light. Such efforts are by people who inspire new beginnings and revolution in a culture which happens first on individual and energy  level to few humans then it activates the culture.
Among many of you are such alchemists of humanity but feeling as worse of humans filled with hopelessness.

So best way to activate your inner True identity which is hidden behind your chameleon personality changing and becoming a different person in front of each person you meet and you wonder what is wrong with me.
Follow trust and commit to your hearts passion because in that inner child lies the being you are supposed to be then all tragedies and misfortunes will make sense.

Your first real commitment to life, to light and to yourself is about following and nurturing your hearts passion not obligations of greed and fear. 

This passion like a seed knows what your tree of growth is and please don't judge your heart's passion but trust the passion which is spark of light and divinity in you, it does not matter what your direction of passion is. 
Also do not try to imagine what your true individuality is but discover because everything in life is unique and original internet or books has no reference for who you are going to be.

Remember you chose this life and time so stand up to your choice and take charge of your energy and light which is serving dark ways of our culture and relations.

Know the authority of fire and know the humility of water in you. Which means act with passion and be still and listen with care to your life.

In other words creativity and silence. 

Don't get destroyed by the ways of ego which is claiming action as it's property for dominance and taking silence and listening to be useless.

I am looking for my tribe so come out of self pity and self indulgence, rise up participate and communicate so others like you know you exist. 

Let us shine that is the best thing to do in dark times instead of fighting darkness😂😂😂

Ram Ram 🙏♥️🙏

Understanding the difference between repression and willful restriction.

First you need to understand cosmically the word Ram

Ra is the sun amd ma is the moon.
Which means source of light is wisdom, the sun, the spark of creation.
Moon is the mind reflecting the wisdom of inner being and it's flow. Moon is also related with water which is the wisdom or water flow in us, it is pure wisdom untainted by mind the other aspect of moon. It translates the wisdom of sun into action through earth, the body. Which becomes creativity and our actions into life if ego mind does not interupt it.

So what is ego mind in the cosmic sense? because it will help you to understand surrender of the action.

So when moon/mind in us start to think that that I am the source of light and wisdom. It starts to think and claim authority over the light it has, which creates darkness and death. 
So wisdom like sun light when gets trapped into the moon which is barren and no life is possible on it. Light needs earth the body apparatus to become prosperity and action. 
We all are suffering from our moon the mind and center for sun is heart. 

For mind you need to understand the difference between flowing and spilling. 

When you are flowing it is in tune with life creativity and manifestation of energy into action. 
When you are spilling it is light energy is stuck in the thoughts and depleting the creative energy into thoughts and mind fucks which creates no new babies 😂😂😂 hint hint. 

So repression is by the mind of the creative expression and flow of the energy by judging it repressing it and not giving energy new direction that is the core of all our issues. Culprits are judgement against sex, joy, anger, creativity so mind uses all the repressed energies into creating mind fucks and wonders where are my babies of success, prosperity and connections. 
This mind needs a willful restriction along with a creative direction to energy, restriction alone will not work because your mind will fall into trap of same mind fuck. Because energy needs expression. 
Mind fuck also needs energy but no real partner though. 
Energy needs a partner and flow in creative action to make babies but does not need mind fuck. 

So when mind is busy into not creating babies but imagining babies then you need to restrict it by directing the mind into creative action. Here japa, chanting in mind watching the breath or becoming present to present moments sensory experiences can help a lot because you cannot just stop the mind but you need to direct that mind energy into action.

For creative restriction of mind it is most fun but very painful because mind won't let go of it's obsessions with thinking and says fuck everything else. You need to develop this power to restrict the mind of its habits and you can great deal of power and creativity in your life. It can make your life charismatic and productive. It becomes a powerful weapon when you move in society all intrusions happen because of our weakened mind and it's thoughts, which believes itself to be the master.
If your mind start to serve as tool to life to divine that is the satwic and spiritual mind.
Here is practise no joke but it will give you glimpse this technique if you can manage you will have a new power. It's, a sudden method. 

Practise1
On Internet start watching a movie or anything which is very interesting for your mind to indulge in and then suddenly stop watching right in the middle of the movie and put off your TV or laptop or smart phone. Make a command that I won't watch and participate in this energy spill. It will be a hell in the beginning you will see your ego mind freaking out at this loss of power and try to convince you please just this one time. It will be behaving like a corrupt political leader scaring you giving you convincing reasons etc.

26/09/23, 10:14 - Vinay Gowda: This problem can be addressed at multiple levels with the citizens installing rain harvesting in their home as Bengaluru receives rain throughout the year. Farmers should diversify their crops as sugarcane is a water intensive crop . Overall increasing the ground water capacity through afforestation is much needed.
26/09/23, 10:16 - Vinay Gowda: People like Vinod should stop eating aloo samosa, jalebi and start eating millet crops like ragi jowar etc which takes less water

29/09/23, 09:13 - Vinay Gowda: Namaskaram,

I would like to share the morning sleeping experience, I had when guru pooja was performed at Surayakund.

This happened during LOM program. On the first day due to rain the program stretched to until 1 am in night. I went to sleep near the Surayakund, in the morning when i woke up i saw Guru pooja was just began and there were people around sitting and chanting.  Since the pooja had already began and few people were still sleeping next to me, also the weather was cold, I excused myself for more sleep. 

After the Pooja, when i woke up it was completely a different atmosphere.  I couldn't put it into words, it was nor cold nor hot , the whole space was exuding a complete different energy. I felt like waking upto a complete different dimension. 

I have attended guru pooja 'n' number of times. But this experience was totally unexpected.

29/09/23, 18:55 - Vinod: 🤘🏻🤘🏻nice
29/09/23, 19:19 - Vinod: Namaskara,
As per my knowledge/perception/experience consider which ever u want ,please do these steps on full moon day ,if possible around midnight 12:00pm or u r comfortable time just wash ur face ,hand and legs whatever the possible seating position u r preferring please be seated for 20mins in dyana pose with chin or gyana mudra concentrate on breathing & slowly move ur concentration towards inbetween the eyebrows and imagine the deity/guru/nature energy means which ever the form ,and if u r having beeja mantra slowly chant with sync of breath.🤘🏻🙏🏻🙏
29/09/23, 19:20 - Vinay Gowda: Who the hell told u this?
29/09/23, 19:20 - Vinod: Note: spine should be in erectile and face slightly upwards
29/09/23, 19:21 - Vinay Gowda: Imagining diety and beeja mantra
29/09/23, 19:22 - Vinay Gowda: Yes everybody must do this and share the experience tomorrow morning
29/09/23, 19:22 - Vinod: Imagining deity and with whisper beeja mantra
29/09/23, 19:22 - Vinod: Maa
29/09/23, 19:22 - Vinay Gowda: Who guided u this
29/09/23, 19:23 - Vinay Gowda: Actually you just told what we do in Samyama. Not exactly but somewhat similar
29/09/23, 19:24 - Vinay Gowda: Ramana maharshi, buddhist vipasana all have this kind of a similar practice
29/09/23, 19:24 - Vinay Gowda: Her name
29/09/23, 19:24 - Vinod: Oh ok I didn't know that ,got that what is happening now I am getting clarity why people r going to isha
29/09/23, 19:24 - Vinay Gowda: Diety name i am asking
29/09/23, 19:26 - Vinod: Will discuss someday but these practice I used to do from past 12 years.
29/09/23, 19:26 - Vinay Gowda: Very good 👍
29/09/23, 19:30 - Vinay Gowda: Sangamesh and vilas not having beeja mantra  i guess
29/09/23, 19:30 - Vinay Gowda: What should thy do
29/09/23, 19:40 - Vilas: Yaaa
29/09/23, 19:41 - Vilas: Can we go with aum or  god name chant
29/09/23, 19:42 - Vinod: No worries just build their energy forms and tell their names or omkara
29/09/23, 19:42 - Vilas: Okay
29/09/23, 19:43 - Vinay Gowda: Vinod if something else  happens to them, will rip you apart🤨
29/09/23, 19:44 - Vinod: 😂will see, first let them try
29/09/23, 19:46 - Vinod: Note: if anyone is not comfortable during night please do at early morning
29/09/23, 19:50 - Vilas: We have to move the concentration from breath to between eyes after 20min?
The chant should be chanted? Or we can just imagine like saying?
29/09/23, 19:54 - Vinod: No all process will be in 20 mins if u r not able to  concentrate near eyebrows just slightly lift the face automatically it will & just chant mantra or anything ur wish like while inhaling the mantra should travel inside and just exale
29/09/23, 19:54 - Vilas: Okay💐🙏
29/09/23, 19:54 - Vinay Gowda: Just like shambhavi 21min😉

03/10/23, 14:31 - Sangmesh: ಗರುಡ ಪುರಾಣವನ್ನು ಮನೆಯಲ್ಲಿ ಓದಬಾರದು ಎಂಬ ಹಿರಿಯರ ಕಟ್ಟುಪಾಡು ಎಷ್ಟು ಸರಿ,ಇದಕ್ಕೆ ಕಾರಣವೇನು?

ಸಂಪೂರ್ಣ ಗರುಡ ಪುರಾಣದಲ್ಲಿ ಸರಿ ಸುಮಾರು ೧೯೦೦೦ ಶ್ಲೋಕಗಳಿದ್ದು, ಅದರಲ್ಲಿ ಜ್ಞಾನಕಾಂಡ, ಧರ್ಮಕಾಂಡ, ಹಾಗು ಕರ್ಮಕಾಂಡ (ಪ್ರೇತಕಾಂಡ) ಎಂಬ ೩ ವಿಭಾಗಗಳಿವೆ. ಅವು ಕ್ರಮವಾಗಿ ವಿಶ್ವದ ಸೃಷ್ಠಿ, ಸ್ಥಿತಿ, ಹಾಗು ಲಯದ ಬಗೆಗಿನ ವಿವರಗಳನ್ನು ತಿಳಿಸುತ್ತದೆ.

ಕ್ರಮವಾಗಿ, ಮನುಷ್ಯನ ಜನನ, ಜೀವನ, ಮರಣ, ಹಾಗು ಮರಣದ ನಂತರದ ಬಗೆಗಿನ ಹಲವಾರು ಮಾಹಿತಿಗಳನ್ನು ಕೊಡುವ ಏಕೈಕ ಹೊತ್ತಿಗೆಯೇ ಗರುಡ ಪುರಾಣ.

ಗರುಡ ಪುರಾಣವನ್ನು ಮನೆಯಲ್ಲಿ ಓದಬಾರದು ಎಂಬ ಹಿರಿಯರ ಈ ಕಟ್ಟುಪಾಡು ಬರಲು ಕಾರಣ, ಗರುಡ ಪುರಾಣದ ಬಗ್ಗೆ ಇರುವ ಅಲ್ಪಜ್ಞಾನ, ಏಕೆಂದರೆ ಗರುಡಪುರಾಣ ಎಂದೊಡನೆ, ನೆನಪಿಗೆ ಬರುವುದು ಪ್ರೇತಕಾಂಡವೆಂಬ ಅಧ್ಯಾಯ ಹಾಗು ಅದರಲ್ಲಿ ಬರುವ, ಸಾವಿನ ನಂತರದ ಬಗ್ಗೆ ಇರುವ ವಿಚಾರಗಳು, ಆದರೆ ಪ್ರೇತಕಾಂಡವು ವಾಸ್ತವವಾಗಿ ಗರುಡ ಪುರಾಣ ವೆಂಬ ಮಹಾನ್ ಸಮುದ್ರದಲ್ಲಿ ಒಂದು ಸಣ್ಣ ಚೊಂಬಿನ ನೀರಿನಷ್ಟು ಮಾತ್ರವೇ ಹೊರತು, ಸಂಪೂರ್ಣವಾಗಿ ಅದೇ ಅಲ್ಲ.

ಜನರಿಗೆ ಹೆಚ್ಚು ತಿಳಿದಿರುವುದು ಇಲ್ಲಿನ ಪ್ರೇತಕಾಂಡ ಹಾಗು ಅಲ್ಲಿ ಬರುವ ಕೆಲವು ಸಾವಿನ ನಂತರದ ವರ್ಣನೆಗಳು, ಹಾಗಾಗಿ ಇದನ್ನು ಸಣ್ಣ ವಯಸ್ಸಿನ ವ್ಯಕ್ತಿಗಳು ಕೇಳಿದರೆ ವೈರಾಗ್ಯ ಉಂಟಾಗಿ, ವಂಶಾಭಿವೃದ್ಧಿಗೆ ತೊಂದರೆ ಆಗುವುದೆಂದು ನಮ್ಮ ಹಿರಿಯರು ಈ ಕಟ್ಟುಪಾಡನ್ನು ಹೇರಿದರೆ ಹೊರತು ಬೇರೆ ಯಾವುದೇ ಕಾರಣಕ್ಕು ಅಲ್ಲ.

ಸಾಮಾನ್ಯವಾಗಿ ಗರುಡ ಪುರಾಣವನ್ನು ಮನೆಯಲ್ಲಿ ಯಾವುದಾದರೋ ಸಾವು ಸಂಭವಿಸಿದಾಗ ಓದಿಸುತ್ತಿದ್ದರು, ಏಕೆಂದರೆ ಇದು ಮಹತ್ತರವಾದ ಪುರಾಣ ವಾಗಿದ್ದು ಇದರಲ್ಲಿನ ಪ್ರೇತಕಾಂಡವು ಸ್ಮಶಾನ ವೈರಾಗ್ಯವನ್ನು ತರುವಂತಹದು, ಇದನ್ನು ಸಾವು ಸಂಭವಿಸಿದಾಗ ಓದುವುದರಿಂದ ೧೫ ದಿನಗಳ ಅಪಾರ ಕಾರ್ಯದ ವೇಳೆಯಲ್ಲಿ ಸಂಭಂಧಿಕರಲ್ಲಿ ವೈರಾಗ್ಯವು ನೆಲೆಸಿ, ಸಾವು ಎಂಬುದು ಅಂತಹ ಮಹತ್ತರವಾದುದು ಅಲ್ಲ ಎಂಬ ಅರಿವುಂಟಾಗಿ ಮನಸ್ಸಿಗೆ ಶಾಂತಿ ಲಭಿಸಲಿ ಎಂಬ ಉದ್ದೇಶವೇ ಹೊರತು ಬೇರೆ ಏನು ಇಲ್ಲ . ಹಾಗಾಗಿ ಇದು ಕಾಲಾನಂತರದಲ್ಲಿ ವಾಡಿಕೆಯಾಯಿತೇ ಹೊರತು ಬೇರೆ ಏನು ಅಲ್ಲ.

ಮುಂದುವರಿದ ಭಾಗ.
 
 ಕೃಷ್ಣಾರ್ಪಣಮಸ್ತು

04/10/23, 15:20 - Vilas: Tirumala Angapradakshinam

Angapradakshinam is a rigorous practice that requires immense physical and mental endurance. The devotee begins the circumambulation from the main entrance of the temple and completes a full circle around the temple. After taking each step, the devotee lies prostrate on the ground, offering their obeisance to the Lord.

Before I share the practise to detoxify your system from the ice of shadow world. It is advised that start to do gibberish and shaking meditation ad well. 
I am sharing with you practise this is not tantra or yoga practise or discipline it's engagement with life as friend and a path of devotion and cooperation with the forces of cosmos.

Cosmic human technology

 Practise

Priminary requirements. 

Do it in the morning facing the rising Sun. 
Sit on your cushion facing the sun. Feel your body and sunlight on it. Feel your through your breath earth is connecting with sun breathing in prana from Sun into itself and breathes out creativity giving forms to the energy of the sun. Feel this earth and your body is made of Sun which is light and sound, condensed sound is light, condensed light is matter. 
Breath through your whole body feeling that every cell of your body is made of light and sound from the sun. 
Sit feeling this for five minutes. 

*Look at sun  depending  how bright it is, just briefly close your eyes and listen to the sun don't think of sun light as light but sound of aum, because source of sound aum is Sun. Feel the sun and sound of aum in light vibrating your body. 

*Feel Sun is shining and making sound of aum in your heart Chakra, chest cavity. This is the center of the sun in the body. 
Feel the sun and sun in your heart Chakra shining and emanating sound and light. 
Do this for ten minutes to tune your superficial mind with the hard ware of your being to shift your mind frequency channel. 

*Now slowly, easily start to make sound of aum feel that sun is making this sound of aum into you.
 It is not imagination but the fact. It will help you to become a non doer as an ego and become channel for the cosmic wisdom. 

This chanting is not fast as I told you in previous method of aum. Three or four aums in one breath. Do it like you are singing along with the sun in it's creation of life. 
Sway your body while you make sound or you can be still see how you feel. After chanting for sometime you may feel the fire in you want to move your body hence allow your body to sway let your arms and hands make dancing motions slowly gracefully in tune with the chant.
 
Surrender to the Sun as a friend and guru relax and enjoy it's fire, energy, heat love, light and clarity. Feel your whole body is radiating light and every cell is making sound. This will heal your body of sickness if  you do it everyday for three months. 

*After chanting when you feel it's, enough after twenty minutes   or half an hr. 
Become still and feel Sun shining in your heart Chakra and feel the sound of aum vibrating in your anahat Chakra. 

Sit and let sun shine through your heart. Now feel from your heart heat of the sun is nourishing your body and light from your heart is illumimimg your mind and wisdom. 
Sit and shine feel like a flame, your body and mind is becoming new like the Sun light which is always new and now. 
Feel your body mind energy to be the sound of now and the light of the new. 

End it with bowing down to the sun. Feel its touch and connect with the sun as your guru and friend, send out your love to the sun. 
 Above all trust the Sun and it's power you don't need any proof your life and solar system is the proof. It takes care if you let it. 

Be careful you may fall in love with the sun. 

During the day whenever you become aware feel the sun and acknowledge it like a being and make connection like you say hi to a friend. 

For deeper practises for engaging with creativity and seven colours and chakras I will share personally after you engage with this practise. 
Notice change in energy and events in your life and your wisdom. 
Let me know as things develop. 

You can ask a question as a feel about your life during practise it won't answer through words but through your events and shift in mind states.

Sun culture

Be outspoken about truth and quiet about your lies. 

What you call your truths which are your desires and dreams learnt from a system which wants you to serve it,are not your truths but your lies.

Outspoken about truth is not about your words of spiritual and great concepts about truth but your action which are authentic, creative and supports life not your personal selfish wishes.

Being quiet is also being outspoken about truth, in your quietness you don't let lies rule your silence as that of submission but a silence of authority of light which does not need explanation and justification but it just is as a loud blinding fact.

Being loud is a strategy of lie, like a noise about light by blind person
Being quiet is about letting the light do it's work.

You need to be hardcore which means your inquiry is not only about your issues once fixed you go home into your box.
That can also happen but focus here is to learn to be a garden of fruits rather than looking for some fruits to fill your belly.

In today's time people talk about climate and ecology but hardly anybody mentions the human spirit and it's climates and ecology. This is the most polluted ecology whose climates of body, energy and mind are manipulated, trespassed, repressed and destroyed.

Sun culture is about not creating new revolutions or systems but about initiating right climate patterns and healthy environment for the mind scape of humans. 
There are thousands of people knowingly or unknowingly working for this eco system. They are working in their chosen fields on their own they are outspoken and quiet about the truth. But their struggle is immense because the ecosystem which can provide support for them is very polluted. The pollution is media, doubting minds, selfishness.

Being hardcore is to work not only for your issues, that is just the beginning of the story, but also work for the truth, this planet which is your home, creating an ecology within like sun which gives rise to climates of creation in your consciousness hence you have triggered a blue print for establishing ecosystem for humans.
We as humans are network of consciousness, when you working with human ecology your sessions of meditation and chanting are helping thousands of  human beings around the world because you open the door for the eternal and the truth in your life and this light is available for this human fabric as well.
You will never meet the people who will be helped, people will never know what helped them.
Because in any given moment of time we are eternally one body and mind in this present. 

People with lies have established their eco system of support through various manipulations of human mind energy and earth. 
People with truth are struggling alone without any help isolated, they are out their in the battle bare hands dealing with modern technology and weapons of human corruption. 
Truth does not need weapons but healthy ecology created by enough humans which becomes a power for this body of earth and it's beings who are living through the authority of light. 

Shadows are many but light is one. 

This is how sun works in your heart through your heart.

Let's initiate new climates of inner nature it starts with the only human you know the least about and can learn the most and best about, that human is you. 
By learning about this human you will learn about every human.

Sun culture is about creating network of truth, light and creativity.

Truth needs all of you to shine through you not just few thoughts and actions. It has to become your life only then life initiates you in her mysteries.

But for now a secret of life to deal with the worries of your survival and fear....
You don't need to give up anything in your life but ask for whole life from life. Don't ask life for some fruits but ask life to make you a garden. Don't ask life for some rays of light but ask it to make you the sun.

Coming three mornings are very powerful for meditation as moon also rises before sun and their presence together in the eastern  morning sky creates alchemical energy with in as Ram represent sun and moon.
Do aum chant it with sun rise will bridge many contradictions as well harmonise energies. Next 6 hours till moon set in the early evening energies are to be used as the presence of sun and moon together however moon is not visible during the day but it creates a wonderful positive energy.

Aum Shree Ramchander prabrahmaney.
  Ram sun  and moon representing Krishna the brahma.
Have a sight in the morning of divinity live manifestation of the being of cosmos.
🙏🙏🙏

 inspirations about the chanting.

Limit yourself to present and become unlimited.

What stands in the way becomes the way.

When facing disorder, pain and issues your protection is the fire of your chanting. A blazing fire makes flame and fire out of everything that is thrown into it.

Such is the fire of sound it dissolve your blockages and suffering into your power and wisdom.

Always focus on what is in front of you, is the way to meet divine.
 
Totality and focus is the fire and only power which can activate your life and potential. 

So walking walk with totality then walking becomes fire and mantra. 

Looking become the look.
 
Be where you are. 

Do not train yourself about various things but train yourself to be total. Then whatever you do becomes an art. 

Getting skilled in this one talent of doing each thing with your body, mind and energy engaged totally, is devotion, is art, is juice of life and you can accomplish ten thousand things by becoming master in totality. 

This key opens all doors in your life be it spiritual or material. 

🙏🙏🙏Aum namaha.

ಯಹೂದ್ಯರು ಮೂಲತಃ ಪಶ್ಚಿಮ ಏಷ್ಯಾದಲ್ಲಿ ಉಗಮಿಸಿದ ಒಂದು ಜನಾಂಗಕ್ಕೆ ಸೇರಿದವರು. ಮುಂದೆ ಪ್ರಪಂಚಾದ್ಯಂತ ಹರಡಿದ ಈ ಜನಾಂಗದ ಧರ್ಮವನ್ನು ಅನುಸರಿಸುವವರನ್ನೂ ಯಹೂದ್ಯರೆಂದು ಭಾವಿಸಲಾಗುತ್ತದೆ. ಜಗತ್ತಿನಲ್ಲೇ ಅತ್ಯಂತ ಬುದ್ಧಿವಂತ ಜನಾಂಗವೆನಿಸಿದ ಯೆಹೂದಿಗಳು ಯೂಫ್ರೆಟಿಸ್ ಮತ್ತು ಟೈಗ್ರಿಸ್ ನದಿಗಳ ಬಯಲಿನಲ್ಲಿ ರೂಪುಗೊಂಡ ಪ್ರಾಚೀನ ನಾಗರಿಕ ವಸಾಹತುವಿನವರು. ಸಹಸ್ರಾರು ವರ್ಷಗಳ ಹಿಂದೆಯೇ ಲಿಪಿಯನ್ನು ಅಳವಡಿಸಿಕೊಂಡು ತಮ್ಮ ದಿನನಿತ್ಯದ ಆಗುಹೋಗುಗಳನ್ನು ಬರೆದಿಡುತ್ತಾ ಬಂದರು. ಈ ಕಾರಣದಿಂದ ಯೆಹೂದ್ಯ ಸಂಸ್ಕೃತಿಯ ಇತಿಹಾಸ ಸ್ಪಟಿಕಸ್ಪಷ್ಟವಾಗಿದೆಯಲ್ಲದೆ ಅದು ಆಯಾ ಕಾಲಘಟ್ಟಗಳ ಜನಾಂಗೀಯ ಸಂಘರ್ಷ, ರಾಜವಂಶಗಳು, ದಿರಿಸುಗಳು, ಆಚಾರ ವಿಚಾರಗಳ ಕುರಿತು ಬೆಳಕು ಚೆಲ್ಲುತ್ತದೆ.

ಯಹೂದ್ಯ ಸಂಸ್ಕೃತಿ:
ಸಕಲಕ್ಕೂ ಸೃಷ್ಟಿಕರ್ತನಾದ ಸರ್ವಶಕ್ತ ದೇವರೆಂಬುವನು ಒಬ್ಬನೇ. ಆತ ಸಕಲ ಜನ ಪ್ರಾಣಿಪಕ್ಷಿ ಆಕಾಶ ಭೂಮಿಗಳೆಲ್ಲದಕ್ಕೂ ಒಡೆಯನಾಗಿದ್ದಾನೆ ಹಾಗೂ ಆತ ಆರಿಸಲ್ಪಟ್ಟ ಪ್ರವಾದಿಗಳ ಮೂಲಕ ಮಾತನಾಡುತ್ತಾನೆ. ಅವನನ್ನು ಓಲೈಸುವವರಿಗೆ ರಕ್ಷಣೆಯಿದೆ, ವಿರೋಧಿಸುವವರಿಗೆ ಆ ಕ್ಷಣವೇ ಶಿಕ್ಷೆ ಇದೆ ಎಂದು ನಂಬುವ ಯೆಹೂದ್ಯರು ಆಧುನಿಕ ವಿಚಾರವಾದದಿಂದ ಎಂದೂ ವಿಚಲಿತರಾದವರಲ್ಲ. ತೋರಾ ಎಂಬ ಧರ್ಮಸಂಹಿತೆಯಿಂದ ಬಂಧಿತರಾದ ಅವರು ಮೂರ್ತಿ ಪೂಜೆಯಿಂದ ದೂರ ಉಳಿದವರು. ಪ್ರವಾದಿ ಮೋಸೆಸನ ಮೂಲಕ ದೇವರು ದಶ ಕಟ್ಟಳೆಗಳನ್ನು ಕೊಡಮಾಡಿದರೆಂದೂ ಆ ಕಟ್ಟಳೆಗಳ ಪ್ರಕಾರ ಕೊಲೆ, ಕಳ್ಳತನ, ಸುಳ್ಳು, ವ್ಯಭಿಚಾರ ಮುಂತಾದವುಗಳು ವರ್ಜ್ಯವೆಂದೂ ಹೇಳಲಾಗಿದೆಯಲ್ಲದೆ ದೇವರನ್ನು ಮಾತ್ರ ಆರಾಧಿಸು, ದೇವರ ಹೆಸರನ್ನು ಕ್ಷುಲ್ಲಕ ಕಾರಣಗಳಿಗಾಗಿ ಬಳಸಬೇಡ, ತಂದೆ ತಾಯಿಯರನ್ನು ಗೌರವಿಸು, ಪರಸ್ತ್ರೀಯನ್ನೂ ಪರರ ವಸ್ತುಗಳನ್ನೂ ಬಯಸಬೇಡ ಎಂದೂ ತಾಕೀತು ಮಾಡಲಾಗಿದೆ. ಇದಕ್ಕೆ ವಿರುದ್ಧವಾಗಿ ನಡೆದುಕೊಂಡವನನ್ನು ಬಯಲಲ್ಲಿ ನಿಲ್ಲಿಸಿ ಸಮಾಜದ ಇತರೆಲ್ಲರೂ ಕಲ್ಲಿನಿಂದ ಹೊಡೆದು ಸಾಯಿಸಬಹುದೆಂಬ ಕಠೋರ ನೀತಿಗಳೂ ಇವರಲ್ಲಿವೆ. ಕಣ್ಣಿಗೆ ಕಣ್ಣು, ಹಲ್ಲಿಗೆ ಹಲ್ಲು ಎಂಬ ಹಮ್ಮುರಾಬಿಯ ನೀತಿಯೂ ಯೆಹೂದ್ಯ ನೀತಿಯಿಂದಲೇ ಪ್ರೇರಿತವಾಗಿದೆಯೆಂದರೆ ಉತ್ಪ್ರೇಕ್ಷೆಯಲ್ಲ.

ಇಂಥ ಯಹೂದಿ ಸಮಾಜದಲ್ಲೇ ಯೇಸುಕ್ರಿಸ್ತ ಹುಟ್ಟಿ ಬಂದು ಅವರ ಸನಾತನ ಧರ್ಮದ ಕಠೋರತೆಯನ್ನು ಧಿಕ್ಕರಿಸಿ ಕ್ರೈಸ್ತಧರ್ಮಕ್ಕೆ ನಾಂದಿ ಹಾಡಿದ್ದು; ಇದೇ ಯಹೂದಿ ಸಂಸ್ಕೃತಿಯಿಂದಲೇ ಮಹಮದ್ ಪೈಗಂಬರನು ಹುಟ್ಟಿ ಇಸ್ಲಾಂ ಧರ್ಮವನ್ನು ಸ್ಥಾಪಿಸಿದ್ದು. ಹಾಗೆ ನೋಡಿದರೆ ಪವಿತ್ರಬೈಬಲ್ ಮತ್ತು ಕುರಾನ್‌ ಗಳೆರಡರಲ್ಲೂ ಯಹೂದ್ಯ ಸಂಸ್ಕೃತಿಯ ಲೇಪನ ಹಾಸುಹೊಕ್ಕಾಗಿದೆ. ಅತ್ಯಂತ ಶ್ರೀಮಂತ ಸಂಸ್ಕೃತಿಯವರಾದ ಯಹೂದ್ಯರು ಅನಾದಿಕಾಲದಿಂದಲೂ ದೇಶವಿದೇಶಗಳೊಂದಿಗೆ ವ್ಯಾಪಾರ ವಹಿವಾಟುಗಳಲ್ಲಿ ತೊಡಗಿಕೊಂಡಿದ್ದಾರೆ. ಅವರು ಮಹಾಸಮ್ರಾಟ ಸಾಲೋಮನ್ನನ ಕಾಲದಲ್ಲೇ ಭಾರತದೊಂದಿಗೆ ವ್ಯಾಪಾರ ವಹಿವಾಟು ನಡೆಸುತ್ತಿದ್ದ ಉಲ್ಲೇಖವಿದೆ.

ಭಾರತದಲ್ಲಿ;
ಭಾರತದಲ್ಲಿ ಯಹೂದ್ಯರ ನೆಲೆಗಳನ್ನು ಮುಂಬಯಿ, ಕೊಲ್ಕತ್ತ, ಕೊಚ್ಚಿ ಮುಂತಾದೆಡೆಗಳಲ್ಲಿ ಕಾಣಬಹುದು. ಮುಂಬಯಿ ಬಳಿಯ ಮಹಾರಾಷ್ಟ್ರ ಕರಾವಳಿಯಲ್ಲಿ ಸುಮಾರು ಕ್ರಿಸ್ತಶಕ ೨ನೇ ಶತಮಾನದಲ್ಲಿ ತೈಲವ್ಯಾಪಾರಿಗಳ ದೋಣಿ ಒಡೆದು ಬದುಕಿ ಉಳಿದವರು ಒಂದಷ್ಟು ಜನ ತೀರಕ್ಕೆ ಬಂದು ಬಿದ್ದರು. ಹೀಗೆ ಅಲ್ಲಿ ನೆಲೆಸಿ ಭಾರತೀಯ ಸಂಸ್ಕೃತಿಯನ್ನು ಅಳವಡಿಸಿಕೊಂಡ ಅವರು ಸ್ಥಳೀಯ ಭಾಷೆಯನ್ನು ಕಲಿತು ಎಣ್ಣೆ ವ್ಯಾಪಾರವನ್ನು ಮುಂದುವರಿಸುತ್ತಾರೆ. ತಮ್ಮನ್ನು ಸ್ಥಳೀಯ ತೇಲಿ (ಎಣ್ಣೆಯವರು) ಗಳೊಂದಿಗೆ ಗುರುತಿಸಿಕೊಳ್ಳುವ ಅವರು ತಮ್ಮ ಹೆಸರಿನೊಂದಿಗೆ ತಮ್ಮ ಊರ ಹೆಸರುಗಳನ್ನೂ ಸೇರಿಸಿಕೊಂಡು ರೊಹಿಕರ್, ಅಷ್ಟಮಕರ್, ಪೆನ್ಕರ್ ಎಂದು ಕರೆಸಿಕೊಂಡಿದ್ದಾರೆ. ಸಬ್ಬತ್ ಆಚರಿಸುವ ಇವರನ್ನು ಕೆಲವೊಮ್ಮೆ ಶನಿವಾರೀ ತೇಲಿಗಳೆಂದೂ ಕರೆಯಲಾಗಿದೆ.

ಕೊಲ್ಕತ್ತದಲ್ಲಿ ನೆಲೆಗೊಂಡ ಯಹೂದ್ಯರದು ಬೇರೆಯೇ ಅಧ್ಯಾಯ. ವ್ಯಾಪಾರ ವಹಿವಾಟಿಗಾಗಿ ಸುಮಾರು ೧೭-೧೮ನೇ ಶತಮಾನದಲ್ಲಿ ಇಂಡಿಯಾ ದೇಶಕ್ಕೆ ಬಂದ ಯೆಹೂದ್ಯರ ದೊಡ್ಡ ವ್ಯಾಪಾರೀ ತಂಡವು ಅಹಮದಾಬಾದ್, ನವದೆಹಲಿ, ಕೊಲ್ಕತ್ತಗಳಲ್ಲಿ ವ್ಯಾಪಾರ ನಡೆಸುತ್ತಾ ಕೊಲ್ಕತ್ತದಲ್ಲಿ ಖಾಯಂ ನಿವಾಸ ಹೊಂದಿತ್ತು. ಅವರ ವ್ಯಾಪಾರ ವಹಿವಾಟು ಹಾಂಕಾಂಗ್ ಮತ್ತು ಜಪಾನ್‌ಗಳತ್ತಲೂ ಚಾಚಿತ್ತು. ಇಂಡಿಯಾಕ್ಕೆ ಸ್ವಾತಂತ್ರ್ಯ ಬಂದ ಸಂದರ್ಭದಲ್ಲಿ ನಡೆದ ದೇಶದ ಇಬ್ಭಾಗ ಹಾಗೂ ಮಾರಣಹೋಮಗಳ ಸಂದರ್ಭದಲ್ಲಿ ಯೆಹೂದ್ಯರನ್ನು ಇಂಗ್ಲಿಷರೆಂದು ತಪ್ಪಾಗಿ ಭಾವಿಸಿದ ಜನರ ಆಕ್ರೋಶಕ್ಕೆ ಬೆದರಿ ಅವರು ದೇಶ ತೊರೆಯಬೇಕಾಯಿತು. ಆದರೆ ಅವರ ಎರಡು ಪ್ರಾರ್ಥನಾ ಮಂದಿರಗಳನ್ನು ಇನ್ನೂ ಸಂರಕ್ಷಿಸಿಡಲಾಗಿದೆ.

ಮುಂಬಯಿಯಲ್ಲಿ ಇನ್ನೊಂದು ವ್ಯಾಪಾರೀ ತಂಡ ಒಂದು ಶತಮಾನದ ಕಾಲ ನೆಲೆಗೊಂಡಿತ್ತಲ್ಲದೆ ಅದರ ಜನಸಂಖ್ಯೆ ಮೂರು ನಾಲ್ಕು ಸಾವಿರ ಮೀರಿತ್ತು. ಆ ಮಹಾನಗರದಲ್ಲಿ ಯಹೂದಿಗಳಿಂದ ನಡೆಯುತ್ತಿರುವ ಸುಸಾನ್ ಲೈಬ್ರರಿ ಲಕ್ಷಾಂತರ ಜನರ ಜ್ಞಾನದಾಹ ಇಂಗಿಸಿದೆ. ಮುಂಬಯಿಯ ಸಾಹಿತ್ಯಕ ವಲಯದಲ್ಲಿ ಯಹೂದಿ ಕವಿ ನಿಸಿಮ್ ಎಝೆಕಿಯೆಲ್‌ಅವರು ಗುರುತಿಸಿಕೊಂಡಿದ್ದಾರೆ. ಇತ್ತೀಚೆಗೆ ಅಂದರೆ ೧ನೇ ಫೆಬ್ರವರಿ ೨೦೦೬ ರ ಏಷಿಯನ್ ಏಜ್ ಎಂಬ ಇಂಗ್ಲಿಷ್ ಪತ್ರಿಕೆಯಲ್ಲಿ ಪ್ರಕಟವಾದ ಒಂದು ಸುದ್ದಿಯ ಪ್ರಕಾರ ಆಂಧ್ರಪ್ರದೇಶದ ಗುಂಟೂರು ಜಿಲ್ಲೆಯಲ್ಲಿರುವ ಕೊತ್ತರೆಡ್ಡಿಪಾಳ್ಯವೆಂಬ ಗ್ರಾಮದಲ್ಲಿ ವಾಸಿಸುತ್ತಿರುವ ಸುಮಾರು ಐವತ್ತುಮಂದಿಯ ಡಿಎನ್‌ಎ ಪರೀಕ್ಷೆ ನಡೆಸಲಾಗಿ ಅವರು ಯಹೂದ್ಯರೆಂದೂ ಅದರಲ್ಲೂ ಪ್ರಾಚೀನ ಎಫ್ರಾಯಿಮ್ ಕುಲದವರೆಂದೂ ತಿಳಿದುಬಂದಿದೆ.

ಕೊಚ್ಚಿಯ ಯಹೂದ್ಯರು
ಕೊಚ್ಚಿಯ ಯಹೂದ್ಯರು ಸಾಲೋಮನ್ನನ ಕಾಲದಲ್ಲೇ ಇಲ್ಲಿಗೆ ಬಂದು ನೆಲೆಸಿರಬಹುದಾದ ಸಾಧ್ಯತೆ ಇರಬಹುದೆಂದು ಕೆಲವರು ವಾದಿಸುತ್ತಾರೆ. ಇನ್ನು ಕೆಲವರು ಕ್ರಿಸ್ತಪೂರ್ವ ೭೨೨ರ ಅಸ್ಸೀರಿಯ ಆಕ್ರಮಣದಲ್ಲಿ ಅಥವಾ ಕ್ರಿಸ್ತಪೂರ್ವ ೫೮೬ರ ಬ್ಯಾಬಿಲೋನ್ ಆಕ್ರಮಣದಲ್ಲಿ ಇಲ್ಲವೇ ಕ್ರಿಸ್ತಶಕ ೭೦ರ ಮಂದಿರ ನಾಶದ ಸಮಯದಲ್ಲಿ ಓಡಿ ಬಂದವರಿರಬೇಕೆಂದು ವಾದಿಸುತ್ತಾರೆ. ಆದರೆ ಇವುಗಳ ಬಗ್ಗೆ ಯಾವುದೇ ಖಚಿತ ಪುರಾವೆಯಿಲ್ಲ. ಕೇರಳದ ಕೋಡುಂಗಲ್ಲೂರಿನ ರಾಜ ಭಾಸ್ಕರ ರವಿವರ್ಮ ಯಹೂದ್ಯ ವರ್ತಕರ ಮುಖ್ಯಸ್ಥ ಜೋಸೆಫ್ ರಬ್ಬಾನ್ ಎಂಬುವನಿಗೆ ಅಂಜುವನ್ನಮ್ ಎಂಬ ಗ್ರಾಮವನ್ನು ದತ್ತಿಯಾಗಿ ಕೊಟ್ಟ ತಾಮ್ರಶಾಸನವೇ ಲಭ್ಯವಿರುವ ಏಕೈಕ ದಾಖಲೆಯಾದರೂ ಅದರ ನಿಖರ ಕಾಲ ಗೊತ್ತಿಲ್ಲ.

೧೧೬೭ರಲ್ಲಿ ಇಲ್ಲಿಗೆ ಬಂದಿದ್ದ ವಿದೇಶೀ ಪ್ರವಾಸಿ ಬೆಂಜಮಿನ್ ಎಂಬುವನು ಮಲಬಾರ್ ತೀರದಲ್ಲಿ ಒಂದು ಸಾವಿರ ಯಹೂದ್ಯರಿದ್ದಾರೆ, ಅವರ ಬಣ್ಣ ಇತರ ಸ್ಥಳೀಯರಂತೆ ಕಪ್ಪು, ಧರ್ಮಭೀರುಗಳಾದ ಅವರು ಮೋಸೆಸ್‌ನ ತೋರಾವನ್ನು ಅನುಸರಿಸುತ್ತಾರೆ, ಧರ್ಮಶಾಸ್ತ್ರದ ಬಗ್ಗೆ ಅಲ್ಪಸ್ವಲ್ಪ ತಿಳಿದುಕೊಂಡಿದ್ದಾರೆ ಎಂದು ದಾಖಲಿಸಿದ್ದಾನೆ.

ಸುಮಾರು ೧೫ನೇ ಶತಮಾನದಲ್ಲಿ ಯಹೂದ್ಯರ ಒಳಜಗಳಗಳ ಕಾರಣದಿಂದ ಸೂರ್ಯಚಂದ್ರರು ಇರುವ ತನಕ ಉಂಬಳಿಯಾಗಿ ಕೊಟ್ಟಿದ್ದ ಅಂಜುವನ್ನಂ ಗ್ರಾಮ ಕೈಬಿಟ್ಟುಹೋಗುತ್ತದೆ. ಅವರೆಲ್ಲ ಕೊಚ್ಚಿಗೆ ಬಂದು ನೆಲೆಸಿ ಅಲ್ಲೇ ತಮ್ಮ ಮಂದಿರಗಳನ್ನು ಕಟ್ಟಿಕೊಳ್ಳುತ್ತಾರೆ. ಆದರೆ ಪೋರ್ಚುಗೀಸರ ಆಗಮನದೊಂದಿಗೆ ಇಲ್ಲಿನ ಯಹೂದ್ಯರಿಗೆ ಕಷ್ಟಕಾಲ ಶುರುವಾಗುತ್ತದೆ. ಆಗ ೧೫೬೫ರಲ್ಲಿ ಚೇರಮಾನ್ ಪೆರುಮಾಳ್ ಎಂಬ ರಾಜನು ಯಹೂದ್ಯರ ಪರ ನಿಲ್ಲುತ್ತಾನಲ್ಲದೆ ತನ್ನ ಅರಮನೆಯ ಸನಿಹದಲ್ಲೇ ಅವರ ವಾಸಕ್ಕೆ ನಿವೇಶನ ನೀಡುತ್ತಾನೆ. ಆ ಸ್ಥಳವೇ ಇಂದಿಗೂ ಕಾಣಸಿಗುವ ಜ್ಯೂ ಟೌನ್.

ಜ್ಯೂ ಟೌನ್ ಇರುವ ಕೊಚ್ಚಿಯು ಬಹು ಸಂಸ್ಕೃತಿಗಳ ಊರು. ಯೆಹೂದ್ಯರ ತಾಣ ಮಾತ್ರವಲ್ಲದೆ ಪೋರ್ಚುಗೀಸ್ ಚರ್ಚು, ಡಚ್ ಅರಮನೆ, ಬ್ರಿಟಿಷ್ ಹಳ್ಳಿಗಾಡು, ಮಸೀದಿ, ಗುಡಿ ಇವುಗಳೆಲ್ಲವುಗಳ ಸಂಮಿಲನವಾಗಿರುವ ಈ ಕೊಚ್ಚಿ ದ್ವೀಪವು ಮುಖ್ಯಭೂಮಿ ಎರಣಾಕುಲಮ್‌ನಿಂದ ಸೇತುವೆ ಸಂಪರ್ಕ ಹೊಂದಿದೆ. ನಡುವಿನ ಆಳಸಮುದ್ರವು ಹಡಗುಗಳು ನಿಲ್ಲಲು ಹೇಳಿ ಮಾಡಿಸಿದ ನೈಸರ್ಗಿಕ ಬಂದರು ಆಗಿದೆ.

ಪರದೇಸೀ ಸಿನಗಾಗ್
ಕೊಚ್ಚಿ ದ್ವೀಪದ ಮಟ್ಟಾನ್‌ಚೇರಿಯೆಂಬ ಜನನಿಬಿಡ ಪ್ರದೇಶದಲ್ಲಿ ಕೊಚ್ಚಿ ರಾಜರಿಗಾಗಿ ಡಚ್ಚರು ನಿರ್ಮಿಸಿಕೊಟ್ಟ ಅರಮನೆ (ಬಂಗಲೆ?) ಬದಿಯಲ್ಲೇ ಈ ಯಹೂದ್ಯನಗರ ಜ್ಯೂ ಟೌನ್ ಇದೆ. ಮುಖ್ಯರಸ್ತೆಯಿಂದ ಈ ಜ್ಯೂ ಟೌನ್ ರಸ್ತೆಗೆ ಹೊರಳುತ್ತಿದ್ದಂತೆ ನಾವು ನಮ್ಮದಲ್ಲದ ಬೇರಾವುದೋ ದೇಶಕ್ಕೆ ಬಂದಂತೆನಿಸುತ್ತದೆ. ಕಲಾಕುಸುರಿಯ ವಸ್ತುಗಳನ್ನು ಪೇರಿಸಿದ ಅಂಗಡಿಗಳು, ಅಂಗಡಿಗಳ ಹೊರಗೆ ಕುರ್ಚಿಗಳಲ್ಲಿ ಕುಳಿತ ನರೆಗೂದಲಿನ ವಯೋವೃದ್ಧರು, ಹಾಸ್ಯ ಚಟಾಕಿಗಳೊಂದಿಗೆ ಮಾತನಾಡುತ್ತಿರುವ ಅವರ ಅರ್ಥವಾಗದ ಭಾಷೆ, ಕೈಯಲ್ಲಿನ ಸಿಗಾರ್, ವರ್ಣರಂಜಿತ ನೆಲಹಾಸುಗಳು, ಅತ್ಯಪೂರ್ವ ಮಣಿ-ರತ್ನ, ಹರಳು-ಹವಳ, ದೀಪ-ಧೂಪಗಳು, ಹಿತ್ತಾಳೆ ತಾಮ್ರ ಬೆಳ್ಳಿ ಗಾಜಿನ ಕರಕುಶಲ ವಸ್ತುಗಳು, ಚರ್ಮದ ಹಾಗೂ ಬಟ್ಟೆಯ ಫಲಕಗಳು ಕಣ್ಮನ ಸೆಳೆಯುತ್ತವೆ. ಅದೇ ಬೀದಿಯ ಕೊನೆಗೆ ಬಂದರೆ ಅರಮನೆಯ ಗೋಡೆಗೆ ತಾಗಿದಂತೆಯೇ ಯೆಹೂದ್ಯ ಪ್ರಾರ್ಥನಾ ಮಂದಿರವಿದೆ. ವಿಶ್ವಪರಂಪರೆಯಲ್ಲಿ ಸ್ಥಾನಗಿಟ್ಟಿಸಿರುವ ಈ ಪ್ರಾರ್ಥನಾ ಮಂದಿರದ ಹೆಸರು ’ಪರದೇಸೀ ಸಿನಗಾಗ್’. ಸಿನಗಾಗ್ (Sinagogue) ಎಂದರೆ ಪ್ರಾರ್ಥನಾ ಮಂದಿರ ಎಂದರ್ಥ.

ಭಾರತದಲ್ಲಿ ಬಳಕೆಯಲ್ಲಿರುವ ಸಿನಗಾಗ್‌ಗಳಲ್ಲಿ ಇದೇ ಅತಿ ಹಳೆಯದು. ಈ ಮಂದಿರದ ಮುಂಬಾಗಿಲಲ್ಲಿ ಯಹೂದಿ ಶಿಲಾಶಾಸನವಿದೆ. ಒಳ ಹೊಗುತ್ತಿದ್ದಂತೆ ಮಲಯಾಳಿಯಂತೆಯೇ ಕಾಣುವ ಯಹೂದಿಯೊಬ್ಬ ನಿಮ್ಮನ್ನು ಸ್ವಾಗತಿಸಿ ಈ ಸಿನಗಾಗ್ ಹಾಗೂ ಯಹೂದ್ಯರು ಇಲ್ಲಿಗೆ ಬಂದ ಪ್ರವರಗಳನ್ನು ಹೇಳತೊಡಗುತ್ತಾನೆ. ಬಲಬದಿಯ ಹಜಾರದಲ್ಲಿಯೇ ಚಿತ್ರಪಟಗಳನ್ನು ತೂಗುಹಾಕಲಾಗಿದ್ದು ಯೆಹೂದ್ಯರು ಬಂದು ನೆಲೆಗೊಂಡು ಪ್ರವರ್ಧಿಸಿದ ರೀತಿಯನ್ನು ವಿವರಿಸುತ್ತವೆ. ಪೋರ್ಚುಗೀಸರ ದಾಳಿಯಲ್ಲಿ ನಲುಗಿದ ಈ ಮಂದಿರವನ್ನು ೧೬೬೨ ರಲ್ಲಿ ಪುನರ್ ನಿರ್ಮಿಸಲಾಗಿದೆ. ಇದು ೧೯೬೮ರಲ್ಲಿ ತನ್ನ ೪೦೦ನೇ ವರ್ಧಂತಿಯನ್ನು ಆಚರಿಸಿಕೊಂಡಾಗ ಆಗಿನ ಪ್ರಧಾನಿ ಶ್ರೀಮತಿ ಇಂದಿರಾಗಾಂಧಿಯವರು ಆಗಮಿಸಿದ್ದರು. ಆ ಸಂದರ್ಭದ ನೆನಪಿಗೆ ಒಂದು ಅಂಚೆಚೀಟಿಯನ್ನೂ ಹೊರತರಲಾಯಿತು. ಹೆಂಚು ಹೊದಿಸಿದ ಚಾವಣಿಯುಳ್ಳ ಈ ಮಂದಿರದಲ್ಲಿ ಹೀಬ್ರೂ ಬರಹದ ಸಮಾಧಿ ಕಲ್ಲುಗಳಿವೆ. ಎಝೆಕಿಯಲ್ ರಹಾಬಿ ಎಂಬ ಡಚ್ ಈಸ್ಟ್ ಇಂಡಿಯಾ ಕಂಪೆನಿಯ ವಣಿಕಶ್ರೇಷ್ಠನು ಗಡಿಯಾರ ಗೋಪುರವನ್ನು ಕಟ್ಟಿಸಿದ್ದಾನೆ. ಈ ಗಡಿಯಾರದ ಸಿನಗಾಗ್ ಕಡೆಗಿನ ಮುಖದಲ್ಲಿ ಹೀಬ್ರೂ ಅಂಕಿಗಳೂ, ಅರಮನೆಯತ್ತ ಇರುವ ಮುಖದಲ್ಲಿ ರೋಮನ್ ಅಂಕಿಗಳೂ, ಬಂದರಿನತ್ತ ಇರುವ ಮುಖದಲ್ಲಿ ಸಾರ್ವತ್ರಿಕ ಅಂಕಿಗಳೂ ಇವೆ. ಮಂದಿರದ ನೆಲಹಾಸಿನಲ್ಲಿರುವ ವರ್ಣರಂಜಿತ ಪಿಂಗಾಣಿ ಹಾಸುಗಲ್ಲುಗಳೂ ರಹಾಬಿಯ ಕೊಡುಗೆಯೇ. ಮಂಜೂಷದ ಮುಂದಿನ ರತ್ನಗಂಬಳಿ ಇಥಿಯೋಪಿಯಾ ಸಮ್ರಾಟನ ಕೊಡುಗೆ.

ಇನ್ನು ಒಳ ಅಂಕಣದ ತೆರೆದ ಹಜಾರದಿಂದ ಮುಂದೆ ಬಂದರೆ ಕಾಣಸಿಗುವುದೇ ಮುಖ್ಯ ಪ್ರಾರ್ಥನಾ ಮಂದಿರ. ಅಲ್ಲಿನ ದೈವೀಕಳೆಯ ಪ್ರಶಾಂತ ವಾತಾವರಣಕ್ಕೆ ಮನಸೋತು ಕೈಜೋಡಿಸಬೇಕೆನಿಸುತ್ತದೆ. ಆದರೆ ಕೈ ಜೋಡಿಸಿ ಎತ್ತ ತಿರುಗಿದರೂ ಮೂರ್ತಿಯಿಲ್ಲ ದೇವರಿಲ್ಲ, ಇದೇನು ಮಸೀದಿಯೇ? ಎಂದೂ ಅನಿಸುತ್ತದೆ. ಒಂದು ರೀತಿಯಲ್ಲಿ ಹೌದು ಎನ್ನಬಹುದೇನೋ? ಏಕೆಂದರೆ ಯಹೂದ್ಯರು ದೇವರಿಗೆ ಮೂರ್ತರೂಪ ಕೊಟ್ಟವರಲ್ಲ. ಆದರೆ ಅಲ್ಲೇ ಗೋಡೆಯಲ್ಲಿ ಒಂದೆಡೆ ಕಿಟಕಿಯಷ್ಟು ಜಾಗಕ್ಕೆ ರೇಷ್ಮೆಯ ಪರದೆ ಇಳಿಬಿಟ್ಟು ವಿಶೇಷವಾಗಿ ಕಾಣುವಂತೆ ಮಾಡಿದ್ದಾರೆ. ಅದರ ಹಿಂದಿರುವ ಮಂಜೂಷ (Tubernacle) ದೊಳಗೆ ಸುಮಾರು ಎರಡೂವರೆ ಅಡಿ ಉದ್ದದ ಸೇರಿನಾಕಾರದ ಐದಾರು ಹಿತ್ತಾಳೆ ಕೊಳವೆಗಳನ್ನು ಇಡಲಾಗಿದೆ. ಅವಕ್ಕೆ ಚಿನ್ನದ ಮುಚ್ಚಳಗಳಿವೆ. ಆ ಕೊಳವೆಯೊಳಗಿನ ಚರ್ಮದ ಸುರುಳಿಗಳಲ್ಲಿ ಅಳಿಸಲಾಗದ ಮಸಿಯಲ್ಲಿ ಹೀಬ್ರೂ ಬರಹವಿದೆ. ಅದು ಯಹೊದ್ಯರಿಗೆ ಅತಿ ಪವಿತ್ರವೆನಿಸಿದ ತೋರಾ ಎಂಬ ಧರ್ಮ ಸಂಹಿತೆ. ಸಬ್ಬತ್ ದಿನದಲ್ಲಿ ಈ ಮಂದಿರದಲ್ಲಿ ಎಲ್ಲರೂ ಸೇರಿರುವಾಗ ನಿಯೋಜಿತ ವ್ಯಕ್ತಿಯು ಮಧ್ಯದಲ್ಲಿರುವ ಕಟಾಂಜನ(Pulpit)ದಲ್ಲಿ ನಿಂತು ಈ ಧರ್ಮ ಸಂಹಿತೆಯನ್ನು ಓದಿ ವ್ಯಾಖ್ಯಾನಿಸುತ್ತಾನೆ.

ದೇಸೀಕರಣ;
ಮಂದಿರದೊಳಗಿನ ಎರಡು ಹಿತ್ತಾಳೆ ಕಂಬಗಳು ಹಾಗೂ ತೋರಾ ಸುರುಳಿಯ ಚಿನ್ನದ ಮುಚ್ಚಳಗಳು ಕೇರಳ ರಾಜರ ಕೊಡುಗೆಯಾಗಿವೆ. ತೋರಾ ಸುರುಳಿಗಳನ್ನು ಚಿನ್ನ ಬೆಳ್ಳಿಯ ಸರಿಗೆಗಳಿಂದ ಅಲಂಕರಿಸಲಾಗಿದೆ. ಮಂದಿರದ ಚಾವಣಿಯಿಂದ ಹಲವಾರು ವರ್ಣರಂಜಿತ ಎಣ್ಣೆದೀಪಗಳು ತೂಗಾಡುತ್ತಿವೆ. ಮಂದಿರವನ್ನು ಜನ ಬರಿಗಾಲಿನಲ್ಲಿ ಪ್ರವೇಶಿಸುತ್ತಾರೆ. ಯೆಹೂದ್ಯರ ಮದುವೆಗಳೆಲ್ಲ ಹಿರಿಯರು ನೋಡಿ ಮಾಡಿದ್ದೇ ಆಗಿವೆ. ಯೆಹೂದಿ ಸ್ತ್ರೀಯರು ಹಣೆಗೆ ಬೊಟ್ಟು ಇಡುತ್ತಾರೆ. ಇವೆಲ್ಲವೂ ನಮ್ಮ ನೆಲದ ಸಂಸ್ಕೃತಿಯ ಅಳವಡಿಕೆಯ ಫಲ ಎನ್ನಬಹುದು.

ಸಬ್ಬತ್;
ಸಬ್ಬತ್ ಎಂದರೆ ದೇವರ ದಿನ. ವಾರವಿಡೀ ಸತತವಾಗಿ ಸೃಷ್ಟಿಕಾರ್ಯದಲ್ಲಿ ತೊಡಗಿದ ದೇವರು ಏಳನೇ ದಿನ ಅಂದರೆ ಶನಿವಾರ ತಾನು ಮಾಡಿದ ಕೆಲಸಗಳನ್ನೆಲ್ಲಾ ನೋಡಿ ಆನಂದಿಸಿ ವಿಶ್ರಾಂತಿ ಪಡೆಯುತ್ತಾನೆ. ಆಹ್ಲಾದಕರವಾದ ಆ ದಿನವನ್ನು ತನ್ನ ದಿನವೆಂದೇ ಕರೆದು ಹರಸುತ್ತಾನೆ. ಆದ್ದರಿಂದ ಆ ದೇವರ ದಿನದಲ್ಲಿ ಯೆಹೂದ್ಯರು ಯಾವುದೇ ಕೆಲಸ ಕಾರ್ಯದಲ್ಲಿ ತೊಡಗದೇ ದೇವನ ಜಪಧ್ಯಾನ ನೇಮ ನಿಷ್ಠೆಗಳಲ್ಲಿ ಕಾಲ ಕಳೆಯುತ್ತಾರೆ. ಆ ದಿನ ಅವರು ಅಡುಗೆಯನ್ನೂ ಮಾಡುವುದಿಲ್ಲ. ಯೆಹೂದಿ ಬೇರಿಂದಲೇ ಹುಟ್ಟಿ ಬಂದ ಕ್ರೈಸ್ತ, ಇಸ್ಲಾಂ ಧರ್ಮಗಳಲ್ಲಿ ಈ ದೇವರ ದಿನವು ಭಾನುವಾರ, ಶುಕ್ರವಾರಗಳಿಗೆ ಬದಲಾಗಿದೆ.

ಮರಳಿ ತಾಯ್ನಾಡಿಗೆ;
ಈಗೀಗ ಬಹಳಷ್ಟು ಯಹೂದಿಗಳು ತಮ್ಮ ತಾಯ್ನಾಡಾದ ಇಸ್ರೇಲಿಗೆ ಹಿಂದಿರುಗಿ ಅದನ್ನು ಸಮೃದ್ಧಗೊಳಿಸುತ್ತಿದ್ದಾರೆ. ಈ ಕಾರಣದಿಂದ ಇಂದು ಕೊಚ್ಚಿಯಲ್ಲಿ ಯಹೂದಿ ಜನಸಂಖ್ಯೆ ಒಂದು ಬೀದಿಗಷ್ಟೇ ಸೀಮಿತವಾಗಿದೆ. ಉಳಿದಂತೆ ಜ್ಯೂಟೌನಿನ ಅಂಗಡಿ ಮಳಿಗೆಗಳು, ಎಣ್ಣೆಗಾಣಗಳು, ಮನೆಗಳೆಲ್ಲವೂ ಇತರ ಸಮುದಾಯದವರ ಪಾಲಾಗಿದೆ. ಸಿನಗಾಗ್‌ಗಳ ಸಂಖ್ಯೆ ಸುಮಾರು ಸುಮಾರು ಏಳೆಂಟು ಇದ್ದದ್ದು ಈಗ ಒಂದೇ ಒಂದು ಉಳಿದಿದೆ. ಅದೇ ಈ ಪರದೇಸೀ ಸಿನಗಾಗ್. ಈ ಸಿನಗಾಗ್ ಎಂದೂ ರಬ್ಬಿ(ಗುರು)ಯನ್ನು ಹೊಂದಿರಲಿಲ್ಲ. ಸಮುದಾಯದ ಹಿರಿಯನೇ ಧಾರ್ಮಿಕ ಕ್ರಿಯೆಗಳನ್ನು ನಡೆಸಿಕೊಂಡು ಬಂದಿದ್ದಾನೆ.

ಹೀಗೆ ಭಾರತದಂತಹ ಸಂಕೀರ್ಣ ಸಂಸ್ಕೃತಿಗಳ ಸಂದರ್ಭದಲ್ಲಿಯೂ ತಮ್ಮ ವಿಶಿಷ್ಟ ಸಂಸ್ಕೃತಿಯನ್ನು ಸಂರಕ್ಷಿಸಿಕೊಂಡು ಶತಮಾನಗಳ ಕಾಲ ಬಾಳಿ ಬದುಕಿದ ಈ ಒಂದು ಸಮುದಾಯ ಕ್ರಮೇಣ ಕ್ಷೀಣಿಸುತ್ತಿದೆ. ಆದರೆ ಅವರು ಇಲ್ಲಿದ್ದುದರ ಪಾರಂಪರಿಕ ಕುರುಹಾದ ಪರದೇಸೀ ಸಿನಗಾಗ್ ಇಂಡಿಯಾದ ಪರಧರ್ಮಸಹಿಷ್ಣುತೆಗೆ ಸಾಕ್ಷಿಯಾಗಿ ನಿಲ್ಲುತ್ತದೆ ಎಂಬುದರಲ್ಲಿ ಸಂಶಯವಿಲ್ಲ.

11/10/23, 20:34 - Vinay Gowda: Aum namaha 🙏🙏🙏

To love what happens is the essence of devotion, it is the highest worship and prayer.

To establish the healing and turn poison in your being into nectar, go to the root of suffering in your mind, before you start any journey spiritual and material. The root is complaining. 

The highest virtue which can help you create a deep bond with your life is.. 
GRATITUDE.

Before anything else in life start developing the habit of mind into noticing things you have and be grateful. Imagine if you did not have them how you would long for them. 
Be grateful for what you have stop noticing lack in your life.

This chage of perspective from complain to gratitude will start to open the channels of wisdom and prosperity.

Develop a habit everyday to be grateful for all that is there and happening in your life. 

Appreciate even your hardships then life will show you nectar in the poison which you think is hurting you.

If you can understand this is the highest spiritual practise.

🙏🙏🙏❤️❤️

Points to ponder about gratefulness and suffering. 

WE SUFFER MORE IN IMAGINATION THAN IN REALITY. 

TALKING ABOUT OUR PROBLEMS TO OTHERS AND ONESELF IS OUR GREATEST ADDICTION. THIS ADDICTION IS SOURCE OF SUFFERING. BREAK THIS ADDICTION TO YOUR OWN PRISON.

Point about dealing with mind fuck and discipline of thoughts. 

AWARENESS, SELF STUDY IS ABOUT, WHEN YOU START TO RECOGNISE YOUR CHOICE BETWEEN TURNING THE PAGE OR CLOSING THE BOOK.

MIND IS LIKE A CLOWN AND ACTS LIKE A CLOWN DON'T BLAME YOUR MIND.
ASK YOURSELF WHY YOU KEEP GOING TO THE CIRCUS.

Point of meditation

TAKE AWAY THE POWER OF YOUR  MIND Fuck. 

YOUR ATTENTION.


A note about gratefulness.

IN THE BEIGINNING YOU ARE GRATEFUL ABOUT WHAT YOU HAVE AS YOU GROW MATURE YOU ARE GRATEFUL TO EXSIST.
THIS GRATEFULNESS IS NOT ADDRESSED BUT FELT AS BREATH, OTHER NAME FOR IT IS BLISS. 

WORD KRISHNA 

 KRISH MEANS TO EXSIST AND NA MEANS THE BLISS.
Meaning BLISS OF EXSISTENCE. 

GRATEFULNESS IS THE DOOR TO BLISS WHICH IS UNCONDITIONAL AND NATURE OF YOUR EXSISTENCE.

YOU DON'T NEED TO SOLVE YOUR PROBLEMS FIRST AND THEN FEEL OR EARN BLISS BY PRACTISE. THIS IS MISGUIDING AND MANIPULATUVE.

FOCUS ON EXSISTING PROBLEMS WILL START TO HARMONISE AROUND YOU AS BLISS.

DON'T JUST GET WET IN THIS RAIN OF LIFE BUT FEEL THE RAIN. 

Aum Namaha🙏🙏🙏☀️

13/10/23, 18:10 - Sangmesh: ನಾಳೆ ಮಹಾಲಯ ಅಮಾವಾಸ್ಯೆಯಾಗಿರುವುದರಿಂದ, ದಯವಿಟ್ಟು ಗೋಮಾತೆ ಗೆ ಅಗಸೆ ಸೊಪ್ಪುನ್ನು ಅರ್ಪಿಸಿ, ಇದು ವಿಶೇಷವಾಗಿ ಅತ್ಯಂತ ಶ್ರೇಷ್ಠ ಮತ್ತು ಸೂರ್ಯಾಸ್ತದ ಮೊದಲು ನೀಡಬೇಕು. ನಂತರ 
ಮಡಿಸಿದ ಕೈಗಳಿಂದ (ನಮಸ್ಕಾರ ಭಂಗಿ) ಮೂರು ಬಾರಿ ಪ್ರದಕ್ಷಿಣೆಯನ್ನು ಮಾಡಿ, ನಂತರ ಎರಡು ಕೈಗಳಿಂದ  ಹಿಂಭಾಗದ ಮೇಲಿನ ಬಾಲವನ್ನು ಸ್ಪರ್ಶಿಸಿ ಗೋಮಾತೆಯನ್ನು ಪ್ರಾರ್ಥಿಸಿ.
ತಕ್ಷಣ ನಿಮ್ಮ ಕೈಗಳನ್ನು ತೊಳೆಯಬೇಡಿ.
ಇದನ್ನು ಪ್ರತಿ ಅಮವಾಸ್ಯೆಯಂದು ಮಾಡಬಹುದು.

ಈ ಸೂಪ್ಪನ್ನು ತರಕಾರಿ ಮಾರಾಟಗಾರರು ಆ ದಿನದಂದು ನಿರ್ದಿಷ್ಟವಾಗಿ ಎಲ್ಲಾ ಪ್ರದೇಶಗಳಲ್ಲಿ ಮಾರಾಟ ಮಾಡುತ್ತಾರೆ.

ದಯವಿಟ್ಟು ಈ ಅವಕಾಶವನ್ನು ಬಿಡಬೇಡಿ

ಶ್ರೀ ಕೃಷ್ಣ ಅರ್ಪಣಮಸ್ತು 🙏

Points about balance and focus

WE are not only distracted by negativity but by positivity as well. There is a flow of events and thoughts in life we want positive so badly all the time that when negative comes our mind is overwhelmed by the shadow of darkness and cease to see light. This is the consequence of attachment with positive which becomes trapment of negative.

Take negative positive in the stride of things and focus on what needs to be done now inspite of euphoria and misery.

 This becomes roots and power of your life. 
Slowly you realize that negative positive have negligible role in your life they matter only to your mind and its indulgence.

Hardest thing or practise is to focus the normal everyday cycle of normal action ordinary function. Doing things not in fervour or  indifference but pace needed. But that never happens because mind gets bored and start digging up drama because it needs drama to feel it is there and needed.

Flow is not excitement but a direction and Co operation with the events of your life. Juice flow can't be experienced in excited state. It's a balance of extremes a light of life energy without explosions or defusions. 

So practically stay aware of your negative positive situation but keep functioning inspite of comfort of thought mind wants.
This puts you in driving seat of your life to take it safely to your directions.

A clue to understand is that  present moment is fucking boring to the our mind.

All our culture and it's manipulation through enertainment and indulgence is to grab hold of your power for your need for entertainment.

If you interested in transformation withdraw from entertainment and engage in boring present hidden there is the creativity getting raped by your entertainment.

Easiest and hardest practise is when you are about to get into enertainment of any sort mental, emotional, talk, fight etc ask this question from yourself as Marcus Aurelius points out

"IS THIS NECCESARY?"

There lies the key to life and root of all problems.

Honour and worship the Shakti by engaging into your action of live life than to carelessly feed it to your mind imaginations based in indulgence and misuse.
Try it is the hardest thing you will ask and notice your ego trap then you will know how sincere you are towards your real issues and growth. That is where your real battle is if conquered nothing can trap you. 

Write about your entertainment game and convert it into engagement. 

Aum durgadevayae namaha

16/10/23, 22:42 - Vilas: May be waiting for laddus
16/10/23, 22:42 - Vinay Gowda: Ok got it
16/10/23, 23:22 - Vinay Gowda: Indication of growth as well tool for spiritual and material enrichment.

When you stop looking, waiting and trying for special experiences, when they don't hold much interest for you. 
That means mother Durga is bringing you closer to herself and ordinary experiences and your everyday life start to look real which is more special than special. 

Here in lies the tool for true growth don't seek special, engage with as it is.

The most powerful ritual, technique and worship. 
You can earn it if your attempt is to be sincere to engage not for achieving some special awakening or experience but look carefully at the extraordinary in your ordinary. 

This needs guts as it can become ending of your journey and beginning of your expansion. 

Only condition is you gotta be ready to expand and not to confuse it with reaching somewhere. 

Journeys take you somewhere and nowhere. 
 Expansion takes you everywhere and takes place in now here. 

In material world you need to do to get somewhere 
In spiritual dimension you need to reach here. 
It is called meeting divine where it is. 

If understood you will understand the real point of spiritual and material  growth

They are not contradictions but complimentary. Don't choose one over the other but engage in the nature of the situation. 

If you do a lot where there is no need to do much you will become unable to do much where there is a need to do

Sun shines and stays but it's light moves does and goes everything and everywhere. 
 
This is the basic fault to mix the laws of spiritual with material results in lack of prosperity. 
Mixing laws of material into spiritual results in frustration. 



Material means to move. 
Spiritual means to stay.

17/10/23, 17:57 - Vinay Gowda: Aum namaha 🙏🙏🙏

If you commit to life, life commits to you.

Spirituality is a common sense.
If what is happening inside and around is not divine what else it is then. 

It gotta be this what all great men and books talked about.

 Because you don't deal with anything else but this and they also figured out everything from this. This gotta be eternal everybody talks about, they are gone but it persists. 

Look carefully you think you got options no you have no other option than this. Life can't be more clear than this as this.

 Hold on to this common obvious sense sun will start to shine upon you for you. Initiate yourself into trust of the obvious. 

Your struggles are not with life or people but your struggles with your own thoughts.

Spiritual is not special or ordinary, it is obvious and real. 
Thoughts are about obvious being real, unreal, spiritual material, boring, interesting, close,far. 

It is never far hence it's not close either. 

What you think if cosmos has a mind? What you think it sees itself as spiritual or material? 

See no spiritual or material but this obvious and you in it. Feel yourself in present cosmos don't name it spiritual experience or material. 

You have a thorn of material illusion and to get that thorn out other thorn of illusion is needed to get that hurting thorn of materiality out. 

Now will you worship the second thorn for rest of the life? 

 No thorn did it's work, you throw both the thorns and now you engage with your life as it is which contains all that is.

A dance is a material and a spiritual phenomenon,yet it is more than both, the dancer in the dance😉dancer is the dance 

Look and dance with what is, not what it was or what you want it to be.
That qualifies you for the sudden surprise meeting with the dancer.

  ಪ್ರತ್ಯಕ್ಷವನ್ನು ನಂಬೋಣ ನಿಜ, ಅದನ್ನು ಮಾತ್ರ ನಂಬೋಣ ಎಂದರೇನರ್ಥ??

  ನೋವು ಎಂಬುದು ಅನುಭವಿಸುವವನಿಗೆ ಮಾತ್ರ ಪ್ರತ್ಯಕ್ಷ, ವೈದ್ಯನಿಗೆ ಕಾಣುವುದಿಲ್ಲ, ಹುಡುಕಿ ನೋಡುತ್ತಾನೆ, ಅವನ ಅಳತೆಗೆ ಸಿಗದ ಕಾರಣ "ನಿನ್ನ ಮನೋ ವಿಕಾರ" ಅಲ್ಲಿ ನೋವಿಲ್ಲ ಎಂದು ನಿರ್ಧರಿಸುತ್ತಾನೆ!!! ರೋಗಿ ಒದ್ದಾಡುತ್ತಲೇ ಜೀವನ ಸಾಗಿಸುತ್ತಾನೆ. 🤔

  ತನಗರಿಯದ ಕಾರಣ ಇರಬಹುದು ಎಂದೂ ನಂಬದಷ್ಟು ಶುಷ್ಕತೆ, ಮೂಢತೆ ತುಂಬಿದರೆ ಅದು ಹೇಗಾದೀತು...
•••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••
  ನಮ್ಮ‌ ತ್ವಚೆಯ ವಿಷಯದಲ್ಲೂ ಅಷ್ಟೆ "ಎಣ್ಣೆ ಹಚ್ಚೋದೇನೂ ಅಗತ್ಯವಿಲ್ಲ", "ಜನ್ಮಸ್ಥ ಶಿಶುವಿಗೆ ಎಣ್ಣೆ ಹಚ್ಚಿ ಮಸಾಜ್ ಮಾಡಬಾರದು ಅದೇನು ಹೀರಿಕೊಳ್ಳುತ್ತದೆಯೇ?", ಅದರ ಪ್ರಕಾರ "ಶಿಶುವಿನ ಎಣ್ಣೆ ನೀರು ಸ್ನಾನ ವ್ಯರ್ಥ!!" ಇದನ್ನು ವಿಜ್ಞಾನ ಎಂದು ಆರಾಧಿಸುತ್ತೇವೆ, ಏಕೆಂದರೆ ಅದು ಪ್ರತ್ಯಕ್ಷವನ್ನು ಮಾತ್ರ ನಂಬುತ್ತದೆ, ಪರಿಣಾಮ ಮತ್ತು ಅನುಭವಕ್ಕೆ ಅಲ್ಲಿ ಅರ್ಥವೇ ಇಲ್ಲ.

  ಗೋಧಿ ಸೇವಿಸಿ ಡಯಾಬಿಟಿಸ್ ನಿಯಂತ್ರಿಸಿಕೊಂಡಿದ್ದರೆ, ಜಗದಲ್ಲಿ ಇಷ್ಟೊಂದು ಗೋಧಿ ಬಳಕೆಯಲ್ಲಿದ್ದರೂ ಪರಿಣಾಮದಲ್ಲಿ ಡಯಾಬಿಟಿಸ್ ಹೆಚ್ಚುತ್ತಿದೆ. ಯಾವುದನ್ನು ನಂಬೋಣ -- "ಪರಿಣಾಮವನ್ನೋ ಗೋಧಿಯ ರಾಸಾಯನಿಕ ಮಾಹಿತಿಯನ್ನೋ"?

  ಎಣ್ಣೆ ಸ್ನಾನ ಮಾಡಿದಾಗ ಶರೀರದಲ್ಲಿ ಶಕ್ತಿ, ಉತ್ಸಾಹ, ಹಗುರ ಆಗುವುದಿಲ್ಲವೇ? ಅದು ಮಿಥ್ಯೆಯೇ?

  ಅದು ಹೀರಿಕೊಳ್ಳುವುದಿಲ್ಲ ಎಂಬುದು ಅಸತ್ಯವಲ್ಲ, ಖಂಡಿತಾ ಸತ್ಯ, ಹೀರಿಕೊಂಡರಷ್ಟೇ ಕೆಲಸ ಆಗುವುದೇ? ಬೇರೆ ಅಪ್ರತ್ಯಕ್ಷ ವಿಧಾನಗಳ ಬಗ್ಗೆ ದೂರುವ, ತಾತ್ಸಾರ ಮಾಡುವ, ನಂಬದೇ ಮೂಢತೆಯಿಂದ ವರ್ತಿಸುವ ಕೇವಲ ಮಾಹಿತಿ ಒಂದಷ್ಟು ಪದಗಳ ರಾಶಿಯಲ್ಲದೇ ವಿಜ್ಞಾನ ಹೇಗೆ ಆಗಲು ಸಾಧ್ಯ!!

  ಆ ವಿಜ್ಞಾನದ ಬಗ್ಗೆ ಇಷ್ಟೊಂದು ನೋವಿನ ಮಾತುಗಳೇಕೆಂದರೆ, ಜನರನ್ನು ತಪ್ಪುದಾರಿಗೆ ಎಳೆದು ಜಗದಲ್ಲಿ ಆಸ್ಪತ್ರೆಗಳಿಂದ ರೋಗಿಗಳ ಸಂಖ್ಯೆ ಕಡಿಮೆ ಆಗುವ ಬದಲು ಹೆಚ್ಚುತ್ತಿರುವ ನೋವಿನ ಕಾರಣಕ್ಕೇ ಹೊರತೂ ಇನ್ನಾವ ಕಾರಣವೂ ಇಲ್ಲ.
•••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••
  ಅಭ್ಯಂಗಂ ಆಚರೇತ್ ನಿತ್ಯಮ್|| ಅಂದರೆ ನಿತ್ಯವೂ ಮೈಗೆ ಎಣ್ಣೆ ಹಚ್ಚಿಕೊಂಡು ಸ್ನಾನ ಮಾಡಬೇಕು, ಇದು "ಆರೋಗ್ಯ ಮತ್ತು ದೀರ್ಘಾಯುವಿಗೆ ಕಾರಣ" ಪರಿಣಾಮದಲ್ಲಿ ಇದು ಸತ್ಯ ಕೂಡಾ ಆಗಿದೆ.

  ನಮ್ಮ ತ್ವಚೆಯಲ್ಲಿ 5 ಮತ್ತು 6 ನೇ ಪದರಗಳ ಬಗ್ಗೆ ಹಿಂದೆ ಹೇಳಿದ್ದೆವು.

  'ಸಂವೇದಿನಿ ತ್ವಚಾ' ಎಂಬುದು ಅತ್ಯಂತ ಹೆಚ್ಚು ನರತಂತುಗಳನ್ನು ಹೊಂದಿರುವ ತ್ವಚಾ ಪದರ, 'ರೋಹಿಣಿ ತ್ವಚಾ' ಎಂಬುದು ಸೂಕ್ಷ್ಮ ರಕ್ತನಾಳಗಳಿಂದ ತುಂಬಿರುವ ತ್ವಚೆ.

  ಮೈಗೆ ಎಣ್ಣೆ ಹಚ್ಚಿದ ತಕ್ಷಣ ನಮ್ಮ ಸಂವೇದಿನಿ ತ್ವಚೆಯಲ್ಲಿ ಎಣ್ಣೆಯಲ್ಲಿರುವ ಔಷಧೀಯ ಗುಣಗಳಿಂದ ಮತ್ತು ಎಣ್ಣೆಯ ಸ್ವಭಾವದ ಕಾರಣ ನರತಂತುಗಳಲ್ಲಿ ಹರಿಯುವ ವಿದ್ಯುತ್ ತರಂಗಗಳು ಹಿತವಾಗಿ ಪ್ರವಹಿಸುತ್ತವೆ, ಅಲ್ಲಿಯವರೆಗೆ ಇದ್ದ ಅತಿವೇಗ ಶಾಂತವಾಗಿ "ಸಮಸ್ಥಿತಿಗೆ" ಬರುತ್ತದೆ. ಒತ್ತಡದ ಕೆಲಸಗಳ ಕಾರಣ ನರತಂತುಗಳ ಮೂಲಕ ಮಾಂಸಖಂಡಗಳಲ್ಲಿ ಉಂಟಾದ ಬಿಗಿ ಹಿಡಿತವನ್ನು ಸಡಿಲಗೊಳಿಸಿ, ಮಾಂಸಖಂಡಗಳು ಸಡಿಲಗೊಂಡು ಸರ್ವ ಶರೀರವೂ ಹಗುರಾಗುತ್ತದೆ. ಇದು ಮಾನವನಿಗೆ ರಿಲ್ಯಾಕ್ಸ್ ಮಾಡಿಕೊಳ್ಳುವ ಸುಲಭಾತಿ ಸುಲಭ ಮಾರ್ಗ! 🤔

  ಮಾಂಸಖಂಡಗಳ ಈ ರಿಲ್ಯಾಕ್ಸ್ ಸಂದೇಶ ಮೆದುಳನ್ನೂ ತಲುಪಿ, ಶಾಂತಗೊಳಿಸಿ ಅಲ್ಲಿಂದ ಶರೀರಕ್ಕೆ ಒಂದು ರಿಲ್ಯಾಕ್ಸ್ ಆದೇಶ ಹೊರಡುತ್ತದೆ, ಆಗ ಶರೀರ, ಮನಸ್ಸುಗಳೂ ಉಲ್ಲಸಿತವಾಗುತ್ತವೆ.

  ಹೀಗೆ ರಿಲ್ಯಾಕ್ಸ್ ಅಥವಾ ಸಡಿಲಾಗಿರುವ ಅವಸ್ಥೆಯಲ್ಲಿ ಜೀವಕೋಶಗಳ ಪೊರೆ ಪೋಷಕಾಂಶಗಳನ್ನು ಹೆಚ್ಚು ಸಮರ್ಥವಾಗಿ ಹೀರಿಕೊಳ್ಳುತ್ತದೆ, ಆಗ ಶರೀರ ದೃಢವಾಗುತ್ತದೆ.

  ಇಂದಿನ ಕೊರತೆ ಎಂದರೆ "ನಮ್ಮ ಆಹಾರದಲ್ಲಿ ಪೋಷಕಾಂಶಗಳಿದ್ದರೂ ಹೀರಿಕೊಳ್ಳದೇ ನಾವು ಕಾಯಿಲೆಗೆ ಬಿದ್ದಿರುವುದು!" ಹೌದು, ಇದು ಸತ್ಯ; ಕ್ಯಾಲ್ಸಿಯಂ ಹೆಚ್ಚಿರುವ ಆಹಾರ ಸೇವಿಸಿಯೂ ಮೂಳೆ ಸವೆತ ಕಾಡುತ್ತಿದೆ ಎಂದರೆ, ಕಬ್ಬಿಣಾಂಶವನ್ನು ತಿಂದೂ ರಕ್ತಹೀನತೆ ಇದೆ ಎಂದರೆ ಏನರ್ಥ, ಯಾವುದನ್ನು ಸರಿಪಡಿಸಬೇಕು? "ಹೀರುವ ಸಾಮರ್ಥ್ಯ ಹೆಚ್ಚಿಸುವುದೋ ಅಥವಾ ಕ್ಯಾಲ್ಸಿಯಂ, ಐರನ್ ಮಾತ್ರೆ ಕೊಡುವುದೊ?!!"

  ಹೀಗೆ ಮಾನವ ಜೀವನಕ್ಕೆ ಲಾಭ ಇರುವ ಸತ್ಯಗಳನ್ನು ತನ್ನ ಬಾಲಿಶ ತಿಳಿವಳಿಕೆಯ ಮಾಹಿತಿಯಿಂದ ಅಡ್ಡದಾರಿಗೆ ಎಳೆಯುವುದು ಮಾತ್ರ ವಿಜ್ಞಾನವೇ? 

  ನನಗೆ ತಿಳಿಯದ ಕಾರಣ ಪರಿಣಾಮದಲ್ಲಿ ಹಿತವಾಗುವುದನ್ನು ತಿಳಿಸುವ ಭಾರತೀಯರ ಆಚರಣೆಗಳು ಅವೈಜ್ಞಾನಿಕವೇ?

✍️: ಇಂದಿನ ವಿಷಯ:
  ಸೋಪನ್ನು ಬಿಡಿ; ತೈಲಗಳನ್ನು ಬಳಸಿ
•••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••
  ನಮ್ಮ ಸ್ನಾನವು, ಶಾರೀರಿಕ‌ ಶ್ರಮವನ್ನು ಪರಿಹರಿಸುತ್ತಿಲ್ಲ ಎಂದಾದರೆ, ಸ್ನಾನದಲ್ಲಿ ಏನೋ ದೋಷ ಇದೆ ಎಂದರ್ಥ.

  ಸ್ನಾನವು ಸರ್ವದಾ ಶ್ರಮಹರ. ಹುಟ್ಟಿದ ಮಗುವಿಗೆ ಎಣ್ಣೆ ಸ್ನಾನ ಮಾಡಿಸುವುದರಿಂದ ಅದು ದಷ್ಟಪುಷ್ಟವಾಗಿ ಬೆಳೆಯುತ್ತದೆ. ನಮ್ಮ ಹಿರಿಯರೂ ಸಹ, ಸ್ನಾನಕ್ಕೆ ಹೊರಟಾಗ ಶರೀರಕ್ಕೆ ಎಣ್ಣೆ ಹಚ್ಚಿಕೊಳ್ಳುವ ರೂಢಿ ಇಟ್ಟಿದ್ದರು.

  ಇದರ ಹಿಂದಿರುವ ವೈಜ್ಞಾನಿಕ‌ ಸತ್ಯ ಎಂದರೆ, ಹಿಂದಿನ‌ ಎರಡು ಸಂಚಿಕೆಗಳಲ್ಲಿ ಓದಿದ ತ್ವಚೆಯ ಸ್ವರೂಪವನ್ನು ನೆನಪಿಸಿಕೊಳ್ಳಿ, ಅದರಲ್ಲಿರುವ ಸಂವೇದಿನಿ ತ್ವಚಾ ಮತ್ತು ರೋಹಿಣಿ ತ್ವಚಾ ಪದರಗಳು ನಮ್ಮನ್ನು ಸರ್ವದಾ ಹೊರ ಪ್ರಪಂಚದೊಂದಿಗೆ ಸೂಕ್ಷ್ಮ ಸಂಪರ್ಕವನ್ನೂ ಮತ್ತು ಹೊರಗಿನ ಆಘಾತಗಳಿಂದ ರಕ್ಷಣೆಯನ್ನೂ ಮಾಡುತ್ತವೆ, ಇವುಗಳ ಪೋಷಣೆಗೆ ನಾವು ಮಾಡಬಹುದಾದ ಅತ್ಯುತ್ತಮ ಮಾರ್ಗ ಎಂದರೆ, ಎಣ್ಣೆ ಬಳಕೆ. ದುರಾದೃಷ್ಟಕರ ಸಂಗತಿ ಎಂದರೆ, ನಮ್ಮ ಸ್ನಾನ ಸುಗಂಧಭರಿತ ರಾಸಾಯನಿಕಗಳನ್ನೂ ಮತ್ತು ಎಣ್ಣೆಯನ್ನು ಕಿತ್ತು ತೆಗೆಯುವ ಸೋಪನ್ನೂ ಆಧರಿಸಿಕೊಂಡಿದೆ. ಮನುಷ್ಯನ ಹೆಚ್ಚಾನು ಶಾರೀರಿಕ ನೋವುಗಳಿಗೆ, ನಿದ್ರಾಹೀನತೆಗೆ, ಮಾನಸಿಕವಾಗಿ ಹೆಚ್ಚು ಅಸಮಾಧಾನಕ್ಕೆ, ಕಿರಿಕಿರಿಗೆ, ಅಯಥಾರ್ಥ ತಿಳಿವಳಿಕೆಯ ಅನಾಹುತಗಳಿಗೆ, ಚರ್ಮಕ್ಕೆ ನಾವು ಸುರಿಯುವ ಈ ಕೆಟ್ಟ ಅಂಶಗಳೇ ಆಗಿವೆ. 🤔

  ಸರ್ವದಾ ಶೂಲ, ಆಯಾಸಗಳಿಂದ ಕೂಡಿರುವುದನ್ನೇ chronic fatigue syndrome ಎನ್ನುತ್ತೇವೆ.

  ನಿತ್ಯವೂ ಎಣ್ಣೆ ಬಳಸಿ ಸ್ನಾನ ಮಾಡಿ ನೋಡಿ, ಅದರ ಪರಿಹಾರ ನಿಧಾನವಾಗಿ ಮತ್ತು ಸಂಪೂರ್ಣವಾಗಿ ಆಗುತ್ತದೆ.

  ಅನೇಕರು ಬಳಸಬಹುದಾದ ಎಣ್ಣೆಗಳ ಮಾಹಿತಿ ಕೇಳಿದ್ದಾರೆ ಮತ್ತು ಶುದ್ಧ ತಯಾರಕರ ಬಗ್ಗೆಯೂ ಕೇಳಿದ್ದಾರೆ --

ಬಳಸುವ ತೈಲಗಳು:
  1) ಅಶ್ವಗಂಧ ಬಲಾ ಲಾಕ್ಷಾದಿ ತೈಲ
  2) ಮಹಾಮಾಷ ತೈಲ
  3) ಮಹಾ ಮಂಜಿಷ್ಠಾದಿ ತೈಲ

  ಇವುಗಳನ್ನು ಸಮ‌ಪ್ರಮಾಣದಲ್ಲಿ ಮಿಶ್ರ ಮಾಡಿಟ್ಟುಕೊಂಡು ಬಳಸಬಹುದು.

ಅಥವಾ

  ಅಥರ್ವ ತಯಾರಿಕೆಯ ವಾತಪಿತ್ತಾಂತಕ ತೈಲ(VP Taila) ಬಳಸಬಹುದು. ಇಲ್ಲಿ ಶುದ್ಧ ಎಳ್ಳೆಣ್ಣೆ ಮತ್ತೆ A2 ಹಾಲನ್ನು ಅಂದರೆ ದೇಸೀ ತಳಿಯ ಹಾಲನ್ನು ಬಳಸಿ ತಯಾರಿಸಿದ್ದೇವೆ. ಆದರೆ, ಎಲ್ಲರೂ ಕೇಳಿದರೆ ಒಮ್ಮೆಗೇ ಸಿಗುವುದು ಕಷ್ಟ, ನಮ್ಮ ಚಿಕಿತ್ಸಾ ಬಳಕೆಗೆ ಮಾತ್ರ ಯ ಇಟ್ಟುಕೊಂಡಿದ್ದೇವೆ. ಹಲವರಿಗೆ ಮಾತ್ರ ತಲುಪಿಸಬಹುದು.

  ಯಾವ ಕಂಪನಿ ತೈಲ‌ ಸೂಕ್ತ ಎಂದಿದ್ದಾರೆ ಹಲವರು -- ಎಲ್ಲರೂ A2 ಹಾಲನ್ನು ಬಳಸುತ್ತಿರುವರೇ? ಗೊತ್ತಿಲ್ಲ. ಕಂಪನಿ ದೊಡ್ಡದಾದಂತೆ ಶುದ್ಧ ಹಾಲು ಸಿಗುವ ಪ್ರಮಾಣ ಕುಗ್ಗುತ್ತದೆ, ಆಗ ಅನುಸರಿಸಿಕೊಂಡು ತಯಾರಿಸುವ ಪ್ರಮಾದ ಆರಂಭವಾಗುತ್ತದೆ.

  ಹಾಗಾಗಿ ನಿರ್ದಿಷ್ಠ ಕಂಪನಿಯಲ್ಲಿ ಎಲ್ಲವೂ ಶುದ್ಧ ಎಂದಲ್ಲ, ಶುದ್ಧ ಎಳ್ಳೆಣ್ಣೆ ಬಳಸುವ ಕಂಪನಿಗಳ ಬಗ್ಗೆ ಹೇಳಬಹುದು.

  ಅವುಗಳೆಂದರೆ -- ಪೆಂಟಾಕೇರ್, ಆಯುರ್‌ಫಾರ್ಮಾ, ಬೆಂಗಳೂರು, ಕೊಟ್ಟಕ್ಕಲ್ ಆಯುರ್‌ವೈದ್ಯಶಾಲಾ, ನಾಗಾರ್ಜುನ ಆಯುರ್ವೇದ ಕಂಪನಿ...

  ಉತ್ತರ ಭಾರತದ ಕಂಪನಿಗಳ ತೈಲ ಸೂಕ್ತವಲ್ಲ, ಅವು ದುಬಾರಿ, ಏಕೆಂದರೆ ಎಳ್ಳೆಣ್ಣೆಯನ್ನು ದಕ್ಷಿಣದಿಂದ ಆಮದು ಮಾಡಿಕೊಂಡು, ಅದರಿಂದ ತೈಲ ತಯಾರಿಸಿ ಮತ್ತೆ ಇಲ್ಲಿಗೆ ರವಾನಿಸಲು ದುಬಾರಿ ಆಗುತ್ತವೆ.

  ತ್ವಚಾ ಆರೋಗ್ಯಕ್ಕೆ ಮತ್ತು ಅದರ ಸೌಂದರ್ಯಕ್ಕೆ ತೈಲ ಬಳಸಿ ಅದನ್ನು ಕಡಲೆಹಿಟ್ಟಿನಿಂದ ತೊಳೆಯಿರಿ. ಯಾವ ಸೋಪೂ ಬೇಡ, ಕೇವಲ 14 ದಿನಗಳಲ್ಲಿ ಗಮನೀಯ ಬದಲಾವಣೆ ಕಾಣುವಿರಿ. 🤔

     🙏 ಧನ್ಯವಾದಗಳು 🙏

26/10/23, 06:33 - Sangmesh: Live what you say. Practice what you preach. We live two lives – one for others and one for ourselves. Man is an amphibian, says Aldous Huxley. Walk you talk. Bridge the gap between the precept and practice, intention and execution, thought, word and deed. Meditation helps you to fully develop your faculties and live a fuller life.

26/10/23, 12:22 - Vinay Gowda: Just do this experiment 

When you go to a super market or shopping do not look here and there , especially in random people eyes. Just bend your head down and have limited interaction with the surrounding people eyes. Then you will see lot of your energy get saved!

Because eyes are the biggest energy dissipators . This why in the mythology in many ways its been told that shiva opened his 3rd eye to burn  , shrinivasa kalyana movie jamadagni muni eyes, keshava muni burned a bird with his eyes etc etc and so on..
26/10/23, 12:23 - Vilas: Wow okay 🙏

28/10/23, 10:41 - Vinay Gowda: The word for health in Sanskrit is swastha. Swa means self stha means established.
Health emplies three levels of health not just body.

As a body you are established into your navel center called swathishdhana meaning place of self. Body is like a wheel with with cog in the center if you take that center out wheel will crash. The center of the wheel keeps the wheel together. Body is like flame  arising out of the center. 

Health on mental level is you are not established into the thoughts as your truth but as an awareness as the blank page on which thoughts appear. A book implies not only written words but blank pages as well other wise no book is possible.
Mentally to be established into a belief or concept is disease. To be in state of silence and awareness is health. Light from the fire of the center. 

Emotionally if you are dependent on the other is state of ill health. When your energy emotion radiates as your nature like heat from the fire of the center, not established into the other then that is emotional health. You share love as the nature of energy not any emotional concepts and expectation.

Get established into center and relax.
Chuang Tzu a daoist master said about center and action.

EASY IS RIGHT.
RIGHT IS EASY.

Functioning in life with ease is  spiritual because cosmos is not forcing but flowing easily.
Ease is the flow.
Ease is the health.
Ease is the state of surrender.

Functioning in complex situations with ease which means being here with focused action rest is not into your hands but the flow of ease, the flow of cosmos.
Stress and complexity is future oriented.
Relaxed responsive action is the greatest force and art of movement.
Any artist or skilled person is great because they do cvomplex looking action with ease.
Let this be your key  criterion for life function meditate create but with ease not the stress and rush of mind and tomorrow.
Remember here it is not about lazy attitude of doing easy things but even hard work with ease of one action at a time.

 Complex is future action, present action is a non doing because it is a response not a reaction of stressed mind about future. 

Ease is health of action.
Look at this complex cosmos functioning with ease which implies the mastery of the cosmic artist.
🙏🙏🙏

01/11/23, 22:02 - Sangmesh: Ramana geetha alli beautiful explanation -- The Shakti which is the cause of creation is Parameswari. 
This Shakti moves about in all creatures. The Shakti in the 
body is called Kundalini. It starts in the basic Muladhara 
Chakra, rises to the heart centre and reaches the head and 
pervades the whole being (body). This is the cause of all 
movements in all creatures. It works as ignorance in those 
who think they are the bodies. In those Jnanis, who are 
devoid of any desire, it is pure Kundalini Shakti. It shines 
in the heart centre as d’ and mingles with Sat and as a result 
the yogi becomes steady in the Atma. During tapas, yogis 
get these darshanas. This is called Kundalini Vidya.
01/11/23, 22:20 - Vinay Gowda: 🙏🙏🙏

Talks with myself. 

We are always working.
Either with the past or about the future.
 Or With the past on the future.
Or with the future on the present which is past basically. 

We always wonder why things don't work.
But in the EMT "earth mean time" which is 24 hours happening together at any given moment on earth. 
 The boring not so known present is working, with you, on you, along with you and on all the times. 

Buddha's famous statement,
"Truth is that which works"

Work with that which works.

Work with that which is here and around, not with which never happened really or will happen at all.
Like idea of free will is as idiotic a memory game as time is.
You are a human idiot not necessarily social idiot if you live in past or future. 
That means living in a place which does not really exist.

A free will is not really free because you want it because you are bound by desire.

Free will means freedom to choose the prison.

Free will really means when you do not will a future or remember a past, when your will, light falls upon what is.

Mind gives direction to your attention which becomes intention. 
Then intention becomes desire to give birth to the idea of time and future. You start to live in a perdictable, secure boring world.
Missing present moment  the magic of cosmos. Source of all juice and joy.

Once you start to live in this magic you will find people living in time are most boring humans.
People living in this zone need entertainment and addiction.

Boring means that which drains your energy but does not engage your energy.

If you are engaged in any future or past you will drain yourself and others. Hence you are boring.

Magic of the present is you may feel lonely with vast crowd of time virus stricken humans but you never feel short of joy because aloneness is as vast as cosmos.
Welcome yourself to the magic world of manifestation. What more you can ask if you are the whole cosmos.

Then your will is free from will and it becomes attention.

When your attention like a focused light is free from focus it becomes light like sun, free from direction but spreading in every direction. Awareness. Other name of awareness is Now. 

Thought is a leaf.
Attention is a branch.
Awareness is the trunk.
Root is the fruit which is creativity the original intention. 
Cosmos is root and fruit together. 
Don't blame me for paradox this is what happens when there is no time and all the times happening together. 

Root is the whole tree
Present is the cosmos.

Happy to confuse  you are welcome.

While passing through a desert 🏜 his army encountered desert storm due to which Alexander got separated from his army and started to starve for water. He came across a indian saint with a kamandala of water carrying,  he approached him and gave some coins in return for water , the saint looking at him just walked away. Next time also he offered the saint with half of his kingdom, the saint didnt even care. After some days Alexander become extremely thirsty of water to an extent his whole life depends on it. Then when he again came across the saint he offered his whole kingdom for a cup of water!

04/11/23, 11:41 - Vinay Gowda: There is no higher force or dark force.
There is only this force which becomes the force you think of.

Know yourself as an action.
Know yourself as a sound.
Know yourself as presence here.

Presence becomes action and word.

Be arrogant and humble
Which means do things like a gaint but never take the credit.

Be totally engaged with people and life but don't be attached like a mirror. 

You can do it if you know your action as of cosmos
If you know your sound as sound of the cosmos.
If you know yourself as prsence as cosmos itself.

Remember I am saying if you know not believe. To know means to become the action, to be total. To believe is leakage of power into thinking. 

Arrogance is like sun shining
Humility is like sun serving the grass to grow.

Power is useful when it serves life.
Power is destructive when it serves the ego.

Be powerful and weak at the same time.
In weak you gather energy. 
In action you expand power. 

Weak means receptive and listening. 
Power means creativity and manifesting the received, speaking the heard. 

There is no creativity without receptivity, it's negative arrogance without humility. 
There is no humility without creativity, it's being a victim negative receptivity of garbage bin. 

Like a dog let your mind run around you bark wag its tail at you when you are walking or running. 

When you sit down to watch sunset. As dog learns to be still when you are still teach your mind to be still. It sits with you watching.

The problem in our life is not mind but there is no commander which tells what needs to be done. Mind need not be eradicated but made friend a dog which is loving cute and ferocious when it comes to protect the master.

Your mind needs a master to serve not a servant to comply to it's tantrums.

Best way for mastery is start to have an acquaintance with yourself as presence and silence.
Way for power is let that presence act.
Way for poetry and command is to let that silence sing and presence speak.
Let your mind wag it's tail not bark at you. 😉😂

09/11/23, 21:10 - Vilas: I think:
We should show our top notch skills mainly. It's workplace or market place beautified by professionalism and formals!!😛
So called spiritual path is purely inner path, which may start once we hv stabilised or ease with our materialistic requirements.
We should become so ordinary, people should recognise or ask to us. Den we may share a little. Other times just silence n enhance ourself.
09/11/23, 21:10 - Vilas: Y?

10/11/23, 18:44 - Vinay Gowda: In this beautiful journey
The intension, the intended and the intender are one.
If you hold on to micro whole universe macro is you.
If you try to grab the macro with thoughts you loose everything which is one thing.
Don't worry about getting lost because you never go anywhere you were always here, you will be always here. In short be here and everywhere.
But there is no point in being here if you don't dance which is cosmos your dance.
Sleep today not in your room or your city or country but rest in your being your home this this this always this.
Play with thought
Play with time
But never get played by them.
They are your moves of your dance.
Once you rest the dance rests.

Play well
Rest well.
Gods will come looking for you.

11/11/23, 15:33 - Vinay Gowda: 🙏🙏🙏

The psychological significance of Ramayana very rarely talked about. It is about your interior micro cosmos.
Ram is your divine self, laxman represents the out going mind and wisdom, shatrughan the third brother represent the aesthetic aspect of our being. Bharat represents the aspect of consciousness wisdom which functions when we are asleep, an aspect represented by bharat who as ego did not become the king himself lived in jungle and ran kingdom in absence of Ram.
A selfless ego less devotion to life as body functions in sleep keeping the body kingdom working when you are asleep.

Sita represents the energy aspect the electric wisdom body, energy mind.

So kidnapping of Sita in us by Ravana which represents the ego mind, arrogance which makes our energy hostage and trapped into it's games and trips.

Hanumaan represents the pure flame of present mind before thoughts and emotions like listening, seeing, breathing and body functions etc. Hanumaan is the cosmic movement of energy your movements of present are not seperate from the galactic movements of stars. That is why the present movement body character of hanumaan is as vast as cosmos. This movement is electric so your movements are essentially the movements of cosmic ocean of this electric being.
In practises like taichi or any other martial arts is how to move in tune with present movement of cosmos, not to move like ego or personal emotion.
Experience of this cosmic flow in us is bliss. That is the most juicy part of spiritual development and that is, what I am interested in sharing deeply. The direct contact with our spiritual potential and life without any organized religions, rituals. The real cosmos not the discrription according to philosophy, the tounge tip taste of life not a recipe of spiritual but actual experience of cosmos singing in your every cell and atom.
When your energy burns intensely in this fire all your problems issues are dissolved because they were low frequency thoughts kidnapping your energy.
Chanting of Ram mantra is hanumaan the true devotee of Ram the present moment.
Why True devotee because he is always here with Ram not into any thought, time or game. He is the wave in the ocean of Ram. Like wave moves at the command of ocean a True devotee moves in harmony and command of Ram, the present moment.

As we talk a lot about being here and now, being present the word for present and God is Ram.
Ra is appearence of cosmos the Vishnu and ma is awareness of appearence the Shiva.
The deeper discription of word Ram which I expained in detail in the past the post is below. Go through it read it few times to understand deep lying meaning it's the hardware of your whole body energy mind system.

13/11/23, 23:46 - Vinod: 😵‍💫oh is it so
14/11/23, 10:19 - Sangmesh: Today Bhagwan Mahavishnu manifested Himself as Vamana the Fifth Avatara to save Indira.

The Asura King Mahabali grandson of Prahalada was performing the 100th Rajasuaya yagna by which he will be automatically eligible for Indiras post.

Knowing this the present Indira rushed to Vaikuntha and requested Bhagavan Mahavishnu to kill the Asura, But Bhagwan said as I had promised Prahalada that in future I shall not kill any descendeds so I have to take a alternative method.

Hence Bhagvan manifested as Vamana a small Brahmin boy born to KASHYAPA Maharishi and Deva Mata Aditi.

Bhagvan Vamana went to the place of sacrifice and asked The King three steps as dhana which was given by the King.

Bhagawan Vamana by the first step covered the Earth and by second step the entire Brahmanda.

Now for the third step He asked the King to give Him a place, the king offered his head, Bhagwan placed His foot on King Balis head and thrusted him to Patala Loka.

Because of this Nobel act of King Bali, Bhagawan Vamana granted him Chiranjivatva and said you will be the next Indira for the next Manvantra.

One should read today Vamana Avatara and get blessed by Bhagawan Vamana.

16/11/23, 10:15 - Vinay Gowda: - Born in a poor farmer family
- Received no substantial education
- Lost his Under-19 chance due to politics
- Fought legal battles against his wife
- Underwent suicidal thoughts 
- Labelled traitor by many trollers
- Severe accident
- Dropped from the team

What did he do with the stones that life and the world threw at him?
He made his castle, his fortress, his bridge.

A castle of being the highest wicket taker for India in a world cup.
A fortress that no opposition could beat.
A bridge of 7 wickets that took India to the finals of the world cup.

That's Mohammed Shami for you!!

Rise in your struggles 
Persevere in your bad times
You will be paid. 
You will be rewarded. 

Theodore Roosevelt once said,
"Nothing in the world is worth having or worth doing unless it means effort, pain, difficulty. I have never in my life envied a human being who led an easy life. I have envied a great many people who led difficult lives and led them well."

16/11/23, 15:21 - Vinay Gowda: Cristina shared, “No matter what a situation requires of me, I always say: ‘yes and yes’ – even if that means doing a live translation for five hours. I prepare myself to the best of my abilities; then I call on Sadhguru to please lift me up on his shoulders so that my words can be his words, and I can walk full strides with him, as long as it takes. I don’t know how this is possible, but a different dimension opens up then, which feels like being carried by something very powerful that makes impossible things possible and even effortless. It doesn’t make logical sense, but I’ve experienced this time and again. Everyone should have access to these simple yet life-transformative tools, and I’m fully committed towards this goal!”

One quality in humans is not valued and talked about so much. People who enter spirituality lack this quality.

Where as in devotion and in spiritual practise you need this more than anything that is being BRAVE. A willingness to face all the faces of your life. Quality of bravery is deeply related with heart and love. We have many stories around the world when people are in love they suddenly become courageous and strong. But people call them crazy.

This quality of bravery is the best worship and offering to life.
Fire of bravery and heat of love and light of wisdom.

Bravery is not a quality which only some have, we all have but we are made to mistrust and doubt that power in us.

Each moment of life is a creative creation hence a challenge for your cowardice.
Mind is coward like dark is coward and afraid of light.

Light is fire, light is love, light is wisdom and light is new.

Let me explain what I mean by bravery.
Look at a flower blooming in garbage dumpyard, that is bravery.
Bravery is not violence it is a non violence towards oneself. That means you are not holding your light back for any lie people around you want to compromise. It is reverence of life, protection of life. 

Most of the people become so called spiritual because they are afraid of life. 
It is like you are afraid to get burnt and you decide to jump in volcano. 😂

But luckily for them they enter not in volcano of spirituality  but peak of garbage with a mud hole in it with the sign board of name spirituality.

Millions are on path of spiritual but very few come across it's light, because it needs bravery to experience Ram, Shiva, Durga.
It's not for nothing we call it Rudra and Bhadra which means ferocious and gentle. It is ferocious like fire and gentle like light. 

In the middle is heat the love. 

Love can be ferocious as fire  and full of wisdom like light. 

Wisdom can be ferocious like fire, gentle like love and shining like light.

I share this becaus I see hundreds of people want change but they don't want to get burnt, they dont want to go through the suffering of transformation. 
So people get into spirituality but they get scared of it's fire of wisdom and passion generated, it starts to destroy the old in you and burn your garbage which you think is your identity and your prized possession.

So remember this till you don't stand up for your fire till then you are alone and at the mercy of others for heat and light, love and wisdom.

A bravery in your heart arises when you realize that this life fire in you is Ram. Bhakti does not need yoga, technique or tantra but  a daring heart to trust this fire.
Because of the quality of this sound of aum in you as Guru Nanak calls it NIRBHAU, NIRVAIR which means fearless and no enmity.
 If you have enimty you still are afraid. 
Like fire has no intention or enimty to burn but it can burn. That is why Sikhism created fearless warrior culture because their base was not in enimty but to burn fearlessly. Like in martial arts they say if you can hit with full power but with no emotion of aggression or violence.

In kaliyuga times today their is a different kind of battle is on which is not physical but it's mental. Our minds and individuality is attacked from your family to a politician and religion teacher. They ask you to compromise and give them your control so that they can use you to run a system which is  destroying humans and earth.

They basically ask you not to burn fearlessly, think of others which is datkness, don't rely on your love and courage for life, think of cowards don't make them feel bad, don't follow your  light and wisdom, think of how idiots will feel, first take permission and license from their organizational of idiotic  darkness.

This is kaliyuga where light has to ask for the instruction from darkness to walk in the jungle of life.

22/11/23, 09:21 - Vinay Gowda: Gospel of Kaliyuga

Somebody asked divine because everybody wonders and doubts, gives it names and concepts but wonders where it is. 
Question asked not with respect but with arrogance born out of reading few books by other idiots who try to fit life in words

"So how come you are the master of the whole universe? Why we are not free? Why we suffer? Why there is chaos? Would you care to illumine then I will decide whether your answer I like or not"

Saha sa stands for She ha stands for He. In sanskrit sa is feminine force and ha is male spark. Because divine is both and beyond. 
Saha first smiled with sadness like dark night then laughed like thundering clouds and raging storms. And said
" Am I the Master of this universe really? Never crossed my mind.Where you come up with such stupid games of rule and power? Who tells you such things? Perhaps people who want to dominate your mind. All i can tell you is that if at all i am master that is because I serve this cosmos, I serve a particle of dust to galaxy. Secret is when I serve I become the particle, as I become your body, your breath and your action. I follow your command if you choose to be miserable I become miserable with you if you choose joy I dance with you. Because I serve hence whole cosmos serves me you call it mastery no you idiot it's called love friendliness, participation"

The idiot asked again "So there is no boss. You mean we are free from any obligation"? 

Saha first wondered why I am still serving the idiots because I have to become idiots with them and laughs at its own joke and answers
" Yes O wise one you are free but for that you have to be free of yourself as well. There is no boss or slave but a play in which you pretend to be master and slave. And face the consequence of the game whose rules you choose and you are free to make any rules but then you have to follow those rules where they take you, you can't then blame the boss since we have come to clarity that it's a game there is no boss. So play by rules you make I shall serve your rules but if you break the rules you make I will serve you as broken rule and it's consequence"
"Hmmm" replied the idiot thinking fuck does this mean.. Blah, blah blah ( the text of the questioner mind is not shown here as we all know personally it doesn't mean much) Oh no what if this is someone trying to confuse and trap me. But it is not asking anything I am the one asking, oh fuck this is too much what I have got myself into? No boss? No slave? What? Fuck no? I hope there is some boss out there I can't handle this freedom I need rules and punishment, I can't handle this. I thought I want freedom but now I have it I can't move an inch. 

Saha again laughed at the private gospel of the idiot and said"O great one see this doubts, confusion and fear of freedom is because you did not earn this freedom even you think you are free but you are still not free from the idea of the freedom"
"What? " cried the idiot in agony"You said I am free but now this I have to be free from freedom. Stop fucking with my mind. Is there Real God out there please help me? I don't know who is this answering I don't want freedom please let me be confused and lost at least I have hope, this one is taking, master, freedom, suffering out and I have no hope left it feels stupid. Please I won't anymore ask things for which I don't have courage and wisdom to handle the answer. I humbly ask please what I can do in this current state of mine"

Saha smiled and said with love
"O great idiot you are great because I am serving you and I am in you as you and if you don't want answers and meet me not as a boss or slave but face to face, then serve your life as it is not how you want it to be but what life needs, serve your body not to manipulate it because there I am serving you as your body. Work with me hold my hand which I am holding out to you. Walk with me in this eternal play of life death, creation destruction and happiness  pain. Don't try to rush ahead of me and try to push me which you call desire.

22/11/23, 21:19 - Vilas: Bros,
If we want to experience higher/deep meditation, do we need to have high energy within also?
22/11/23, 21:28 - Vinod: 😂😂there u r missing the teasure

22/11/23, 21:38 - Vinod: It already been installed just need to tap that
22/11/23, 22:00 - Vilas: 🙄Okay😬
22/11/23, 22:13 - Vinod: Interesting part is to tap that u need some proper tools that is where we are lagging
22/11/23, 22:26 - Sangmesh: https://www.facebook.com/share/v/qencerGD2L9uA9CG/?mibextid=97WSwf
22/11/23, 22:27 - Vinod: One more imp thing guys are forgot is questioning
22/11/23, 22:34 - Vinay Gowda: Thats not a right a way
22/11/23, 22:35 - Vinod: 😂ok then just go on listening
22/11/23, 22:35 - Vinay Gowda: Don't misguide ppl with your western intellectual based mindset
22/11/23, 22:36 - Vinay Gowda: The very nature of spirituality is your questions must dissolve
22/11/23, 22:37 - Vinod: 😂😂😂ok fine dissolve
22/11/23, 22:38 - Vinay Gowda: U have no idea on how gurukul system functioned in bharat.
22/11/23, 22:38 - Vinod: 😴😴😴
22/11/23, 22:40 - Vinod: English is western language or native language?
22/11/23, 22:41 - Vinay Gowda: The very nature of question which you are asking there is no hunger in it
22/11/23, 22:41 - Vinod: 😅just give me answer
22/11/23, 22:42 - Vinay Gowda: Just make your question stronger within urself. Just make it as intense as possible
22/11/23, 22:42 - Vinod: Answer this
22/11/23, 22:43 - Vinay Gowda: Even if i gv the answer , you will come up with other someother question again
22/11/23, 22:44 - Vinod: 😂😂
22/11/23, 22:44 - Vinay Gowda: The very place from where your asking the question has no possibility understanding it
22/11/23, 22:50 - Vinod: 😂without answering how can u come to conclusion that question as no possibility
22/11/23, 22:51 - Vinod: Very hypothetical
22/11/23, 22:52 - Vinay Gowda: Because of people like you most yogis took refuge in himalayas after enlightenment. 

Even if they want to share knowledge u guys keep on questioning him from a state of mind which just cannot grasp it
22/11/23, 22:53 - Vinay Gowda: Its like using microscope to know the feeling of flower 🌼
22/11/23, 22:53 - Vinod: 😂😂one more hypothetical
22/11/23, 22:53 - Vinay Gowda: I will give u practical approach
22/11/23, 22:54 - Vinay Gowda: All u hv to do is for 3 months continuously
22/11/23, 22:54 - Vinod: Then he is not yogi
22/11/23, 22:55 - Vinay Gowda: Yesterday god had come to our group 🙏  but then what happened?
22/11/23, 22:55 - Vinod: 😂see no deviation
22/11/23, 22:55 - Vinay Gowda: Some nonsense fellow took the photo of his bloody bottle and asked a nonsense question
22/11/23, 22:55 - Vinay Gowda: Then the god went 😑😑
22/11/23, 22:57 - Vinod: See maha Yogi completely enlightenment being Shiva himself answered many question asked by ma which might seems illogical now .how come yogi present here feels not to answer by thinking that we might don't grasp that😎😉🥳
22/11/23, 22:58 - Vinod: Again same point without answering how u r considering the question is illogical
22/11/23, 22:58 - Vinod: 😂😂😅🕺🏼
22/11/23, 22:59 - Vinay Gowda: Your right sir , absolutely perfect 👌

Just come one step forward.  When shiva saw parvati question not ending what he did???
He just made her part of himself 

There is a dimension which is beyond your question and answer framework
22/11/23, 23:00 - Vinay Gowda: Question is not illogical your intent behind is not valid
22/11/23, 23:02 - Vinod: Exactly u r at my court now, without questioning only by others advice directly ur at the state of silence then there will no use .🦸‍♂️
22/11/23, 23:03 - Vinay Gowda: Through evolution my tail is dropped
22/11/23, 23:03 - Vinod: Again u will not know untill ur answering , u r becoming prejudices
22/11/23, 23:03 - Vinay Gowda: You want my evolution to start again
22/11/23, 23:04 - Vinay Gowda: Your done and dusted here completely
22/11/23, 23:04 - Vinay Gowda: Mic drop
22/11/23, 23:05 - Vinod: Oh then ur completely involved now then is there any use of all those spiritual stuff then😂😂ur done and dusted here itself
22/11/23, 23:05 - Vinod: Evolved*
22/11/23, 23:05 - Vinay Gowda: Off course i am evolved
22/11/23, 23:06 - Vinod: Only with physical aspects or considering with all aspects
22/11/23, 23:07 - Vinay Gowda: See again this question has no intent of absolute knowing behind it
22/11/23, 23:08 - Vinod: How come u know that I am not in intent of absolute knowing**
22/11/23, 23:09 - Vinay Gowda: You have a free time to spare now,
22/11/23, 23:09 - Vinay Gowda: Even if i answer that question,  you will ask one more
22/11/23, 23:10 - Vinod: U r afraid of questions
22/11/23, 23:10 - Vinay Gowda: See how many questions you hv asked already

23/11/23, 08:31 - Sangmesh: Like contract. You wil be a permanent employee to consultancy and u wil work for mncs in there location.All docs salary u vl gey it from consultancy.
23/11/23, 08:33 - Vinay Gowda: Oh okay
23/11/23, 12:52 - Vinay Gowda: What to do with negativity and burden from psychological level?

So I share a weapon in this age of kaliyuga which will release your trust which is trapped into negativity which means you have trust but it is busy trusting the negative and dark as real that is why it is powerful.
You the divine when trusts the negative because you are creator hence you give birth to negative, this is your cosmos and this is your power which believes how to feel reverence when I am burdened?

So to break this net use the weapon of evil within you which is DOUBT. Kill your negativity with it's own weapon.

 Which means we doubt positive and divine now start to doubt the burden, negativity as well. 
You never doubt negative you always doubt positive. Once you start to doubt negative that what if it is, also not True then your journey of Darshan of divine as a fact and truth begins because divine is not a concept but face to face with WHAT IS. NOW THIS. 

This is sutra by osho that doubt everything then doubt the doubt itself, that is the snake swallowing it's own tail. Then what is left is neither negative nor positive but sacred life which is negative and positive together. Have guts to stand in front of your negativity and honour it as well as energy of divine that is how you practise divinity within. Negative is not non divine it's the same cosmic energy appearing as negative positive.

This is the hardest part of bhakti that you have to see joy and suffering both as divine and welcome them only then this death within time and duality we suffer from, it become nectar eternity. It's all one cosmos with everything good evil included. 

So chant and feel everything in life good bad evil thoughts, emotions and chaos and order are drowned into one sound of NOW. 
This is  bhakti right remembrance of divine name. It's not a technique it's a jump of joy by heart which longs for unknown and adventure of life. 

Mahavishnu Jwalantam Sarvatomukham. 
This cosmos the great Vishnu bright shining like fire and every face is the face of Vishnu the divine. 

🙏🙏🙏

Are u experiencing fierceness  today?
27/11/23, 19:08 - Vinay Gowda: Namaskaram,

I would like to share my experience of Tiruvannamalai
27/11/23, 19:24 - Vinay Gowda: I geared up for the thiruvannamalai  trip a day before the actual scheduled trip as soon as  the invitation came. The time was bit less but the most challenging was to get a room at affordable price. So i kept calling people through Google maps, facebook groups etc.. the moment I say them i am single and want a room , most of them even didn't turn back. Few ppl responded with 15k and 10k with lowest being 4k. Somewhere around that time i saw a post in fb for a free accommodation only for family.  I contacted that person and convinced him as yo why i want a room.

Finally i got to stay for 2 days along with their family! They vacated a room and provided all the hospitality and even wanted to pick and drop me up from temple.  It was a feeling of a saintly life. 

When the divine calls you up all you have to do is to jusk pick the call and move on, everything falls at its place as we move on

28/11/23, 09:17 - Vinay Gowda: Day 1:

I woke up to a view of arunachala from my room and packed bag to leave for temple. 

In the queue of donation to karhigai deepam i met a person who assisted me in getting tickets through online but due to server error couldn't proceed later with a bunch of people joined a queue in the middle which literally saved around 2hrs!

Due to the slow pace of queue i got to see the various sculptures of the temple,  since its built by various kingdoms. The parrot 🦜 was highlighted in a gopura, mohini in one of the Dwara was in a dance posture signifying the moha nature which one has to leave before entering into darshana. The inner temple had a good space around it through which one could easily see the magnificent arunachala mountain behind. As soon as i enter the inner sanctum the fire elements were dominant,  when my time for darshana came i saw him in a alankara later they stopped us for Abhishekam the curtains were pulled i was able to stand their for 3 to 4 minutes,  experiencing the energies of arunachala later when they moved the curtains,  it was a plain linga almost in a dilapidated condition they a
Started doing abhishkam with that my darshana wnded and the queue moved on......

30/11/23, 08:33 - Sangmesh: Everybody will go after only what gives happiness to him.
Thinking that happiness comes from some object or other,
you go after it.

See from whence all happiness, including the happiness
you regard as coming from sense objects, really comes.

You will understand all happiness comes only from the Self,
and then you will always abide in the Self.

Tears of joy! Person inside just melted away when Amma hugged and whispered a mantra in my ears. 

The embodiment of Motherhood. 10 million free meals to poor people annually, disaster relief, health care, Ayurveda, Water purification plants in 5,000 village centers, Educational institutes, etc., I bow down at her feet, Sri Mata Amritanandamayi Devi🙏
Sadhguru always says there are only a handful of people on the planet who are 24/7 joyful and spread joy to others.
I was sitting in the hall waiting for my turn. Amma is addressing people. Her glorious smiles, nose ring twinkling like a star, the white dress, made me feel like I was in front of God. It's definitely grace and blessings to have been touched by Amma.

07/12/23, 08:44 - Sangmesh: There are only two ways to conquer destiny
or be independent of it.

One is to enquire for whom is this destiny
and discover that only the ego is bound by destiny
and not the Self,
and that the ego is non-existent.

The other way is to kill the ego by
completely surrendering to the Lord.

15/12/23, 11:58 - Vilas: Thank you Guru Pooja @ 5:30 am
Namaskaram .my name is Bharat. I am from Hyderabad.i am attending this  December Silence program as a Participant. As a part of preparation. From past 4 days.i took more efforts to do Sukha Kriya to prepare myself better. Everyday I was doing Guru Pooja with  audio at 6/7/8 am, and i took  all the great efforts to prepare myself .previously I used to attend Guru Pooja at 5:30 am.even of I don't brush n bath.i used to attend Guru Pooja. One day I attended Guru Pooja at 5:30 am n took a bath at 6 am. I felt great uneasy. I felt like  I lost something .and today I bathed n attended Guru Pooja at 5:30 am  and I finished all my sadhana almost so effortlessly. The efforts I took previously was much higher and today my efforts are very minimal. For me morning 5:30 am Guru Pooja is a blessing. Previously even if I slept at 2am. i just used to keep alarm just to attend Guru Pooja. N I used to attend Guru Pooja .but these days my mother said I must clean the place .mop the place first .only then attend Guru Pooja .but I am not comfortable doing mopping n cleaning without doing Upa Yoga. Mopping n cleaning without doing Upa Yoga strained me  and I started avoiding Guru Pooja at 5:30 am. I have attended Guru Pooja at 5:30 am today. From now on.even if I don't brush .I will attend Guru Pooja at 5:30 am.n even if I don't bath I will attend Guru Pooja at 5:30 am. Well. U may feel this entire creation is happening in the Grace of Creator only. Yes. But I want to be enveloped by 5:30am Guru Pooja. For me morning  5:30 am Guru Pooja  is just like a  unseen protection  enveloping me always . Now I realized that no matter how ever hardwork I put ,it's Grace that makes things happen.  This spiritual journey of mine is a  Grace of Sadhguru. It was Kiranmai akka n Danadapani anna who helped me in attending Guru Pooja daily at 5:30 am.kiranmai akka introduced me to this   online 5:30am Guru Pooja  to me .n one day I didn't got the Guru Pooja link n I asked akka - He said naa -he is available 24/7 n beyond  our logic then y I i didn't  get Guru Pooja link ? Akka said She was not well that day. From next day on to through Danadapani anna .I am receiving Guru Pooja link every day.its already 2 years passed. I am  blessed to be  in this group. Earlier I used to think that if I had a  consecrated  form.it would been better.but I woke up late realizing that Sadhguru had already blessed me with Guru Pooja at 5:30 am .to be enveloped by Grace with me wherever i go.Thank you so much 🙇🏻‍♂️🙏
15/12/23, 11:59 - Vilas: guru pooja devotees!

15/12/23, 13:04 - Vilas: Few days back, there was like friendly argument with my roommate. He told like,
"How come u believe Sadhguru blindly. Ex: U also nt sure wt happened with his wife n non transparent personal life being yogi. May be these things true /false. With this 50:50,how can u believe him.
I am damn sure u hvnt experienced anything in ashram. U simply going for some peace N calmness. He may be next asaram bapu , wt u ll do?! "
15/12/23, 13:04 - Vilas: Though he has also went thru IE and Shivanga.

Here is my gift for all of you practise of Ground Zero.
Connecting with your kingdom.

It's a no practise practise hence there are not many instructions but this is the base of your existence and unconditional relation to yourself.

Ground Zero.

Sit everyday with closed eyes. Feel your body, emotions and thoughts. No spiritual practise it's like coming back to your home and being in your residence. It is like finally return to your kingdom where as you are always since many lives running out of your house.
This practise of just sitting and being inside your body and feel. This is the ground zero, develop your presence inside without any third party of spiritual practise or philosophical, medical reference.
Just you and your body feel your existence.
It is said that our chaos is like servants in a house are running around because master is not home, or Shakti is in disorder because Shiva is not there to attend to her. As soon as master reaches the house all servants go to their appointed places of work and become quiet. Master does not need to try to control servants. Similarly with the presence your energy comes into order. 
This can fix many sicknesses in the body just make it a point to sit with your body as a friend and listen feel everything. Feel thoughts don't think  thoughts. Feel pains and pleasures don't analyse. Feel the vibration of being alive, breath and humming of the body. 

So let it be your life long practise before going to sleep or in the morning just attend to your women, your mother, your only faithful life long companion which never betrays you but you keeo on betraying her, your own body and energy.
Be there feel, attend and appreciate don't try to analyse just pay attention to your sensations, thoughts confusions, senses just be with your friend holding her hand.

It will help you deeply beyond anything. Your body will start to communicate and introduce you to her intution. Nobody is telling you this, everybody is telling you to fix something inside which is male mind manipulative ego which is trying to use body as tool for its desires.
Learn to be with your body then you will know what it means to be loyal, commited and heal.

All you life needs is your companionship unconditional. Then Durga will bless you and start to show you her beauties and magics.
Be with your mind as friend, you don't need solutions you need your presence.

Pay your respect to the Durga, Shakti your body feel her with reverence and devotion. This body is the cosmos. 

Learn the feel of yourself. 

Aum Durga devayae namaha

*ಹನುಮ ದೇವಸ್ಥಾನದಲ್ಲಿ ಇದೇ ತಿಂಗಳ 24 ರಂದು ಹನುಮ ಜಯಂತಿಯನ್ನು ಆಚರಿಸಲು ನೆನ್ನೆ ನಡೆದ ಸಭೆಯಲ್ಲಿ ನಿರ್ಧರಿಸಲಾಗಿದೆ.* ಆಚರಣೆಯ ವಿವರವು ಕೆಳಕಂಡಂತಿದೆ :

೧. ಪಂಚಾಮೃತ ಅಭಿಷೇಕ 
೨. ಪೂಜೆ ಹಾಗೂ ಅಲಂಕಾರಕ್ಕೆ ಹೂವು 
೩. ಸುಮಾರು 400 ರಿಂದ 500 ಜನರಿಗೆ ಅನ್ನದಾನ 
೪. ದೇವಸ್ಥಾನದ ಮುಂದೆ ಚಪ್ಪರ 

*ಇದೆಲ್ಲದುರ ವ್ಯವಸ್ಥೆಗೆ ಅಂದಾಜು 30 ಸಾವಿರ ಹಣ ಖರ್ಚಾಗಬಹುದೆಂದು ಅಂದಾಜಿಸಲಾಗಿದ್ದು, ಇದಕ್ಕಾಗಿ ಭಕ್ತಾದಿಗಳಲ್ಲಿ ಕಾಣಿಕೆ ನೀಡಲು ವಿನಂತಿಸಲಾಗಿದೆ.*
ಈ ಕಾಣಿಕೆಯು ತಿಂಗಳ ಪೂಜೆಯ ಕಾಣಿಕೆಯ ಹೊರತಾಗಿರುತ್ತದೆ. ಹಾಗೂ ಕಾರ್ಯಕ್ರಮದ ನಂತರ ಯಾವುದೇ ಹಣ ಉಳಿತಾಯವಾದಲ್ಲಿ ದೇವಸ್ಥಾನದ ಅಭಿವೃದ್ಧಿ ಕಾರ್ಯಕ್ಕೆ ನೀಡಲಾಗುವುದು. 

*ಕಾಣಿಕೆ ನೀಡ ಬಯಸುವವರು ಕೆಳಕಂಡ ಸಂಖ್ಯೆಗೆ ಗೂಗಲ್ ಪೇ ಅಥವಾ ಫೋನ್ ಪೇ ಮಾಡಿ, ಅದರ ಮಾಹಿತಿಯನ್ನು ಗುಣಶೇಖರ್ ಅವರಿಗೆ ಅಥವಾ ಗ್ರೂಪ್ ನಲ್ಲಿ ನೀಡತಕ್ಕದ್ದು.*

*Itinerary:*
🤾‍♂️ Warm Up
🧑‍🍳 Fun-filled Millets Cookery Competition by locals
🚶‍♂️🚶‍♀️ 4km walk
🍲 Millet-based delicious tiffin will be served after the walk!

📍 Start Location:*

27/12/23, 15:42 - Vinay Gowda: 🙏🙏🙏

Dancing is a complete path in itself. It's  path of dissolution.
Key to it is totality.
It engages all the energies of your being. Mind which is busy in making thoughts which become chaos in fact it's your expressive creative energy looking to form. 

When your energy can make forms into dancing mind slows down because now it is engaged in forming forms through body.

Dance is a way to feel body, mind and energy as one.
Dancing opens all the chakras.

When Shakti cosmic energy takes over your body during dancing, it heals expresses and balances.

Wisdom happens in flow of expression, when you forming forms during dancing it frees your wisdom energy to flow through dance uninhibited. In thinking we are repressing, editing our thoughts out of moral, ethical and social conditions.

In dancing you learn the freedom and feel the flow as joy, you learn your body as joy.

It works like fire which burns all the old dry stagnant energies and pattern.

Dancing is the yogic austerity of a devotee.
Dancing is time when it is your time with yourself and cosmos.

Dancing  a give you glimpse of non duality, oneness. It can make you aware of yourself as wave of cosmic energy.

When people feel joy they dance.

Opposite is also a truth.

When you dance you start to feel joy.

Dancing is a breathing out and a gesture of gratitude to life it's more powerful than any spiritual practise because it's immediate and cosmos is immediate as well. Union with life, yoga with life becomes easy.

The interesting thing is that life has given a most easy way to reach to this union but your mind does not believe or want to believe.
Shiva is called Natraj the dancer, this whole play and movement of Shakti is dance of Shiva.
 
Ganesha is also show as dancing which means dance of Aum, dance of sound. 
To meet Shiva and Shakti you have to follow their behaviour which is dance.

You are a dance of joy.
You are made of dance. 
Dance and fulfill your destiny, swadharma.
 
Dance is the music of the body. 
 Sing the song of aum in dance. 

You will not need to understand surrender or acceptance you will know surrender. 
Surrender is not a defeat but victory. A way to become master. A totality which makes a wave ocean. 

Aum namaha
🙏🙏🙏

30/12/23, 15:33 - Vinay Gowda: Dear Hindu friends... 🙏🏽🚩

The holy matrakshat from Ayodhya is delivered to every house after January 1st.

A committee of ward committee members, workers and Ram devotees will be formed to distribute the holy mantraksha from house to house without fail.
The members of this committee have to follow certain rules while going door to door..🙏🏽
The rules are like this..
 💥Members distributing mantrakshat from house to house must be in traditional dress.
💥Women saree.
💥Men wear white panche and shirt.
💥Those who carry Akshata Kalash cannot wear sandals on their feet and must abstain from non-meat food three days in advance.
💥There should be at least 4 to 5 members going to each house.
💥You cannot stand outside the house and give akshata. Go inside the house and tell the entire contents of the Ram Mandir with the family members and give Akshata.
On 7/01/2024, a grand contact campaign will be conducted across the country. On that day maximum 100 people should be included and akshata and invitation letter should be issued.
All participating Rama devotees should be in traditional attire.
💥 In general, care should be taken to ensure that no Hindu in the town leaves the house and give them an invitation letter..🙏🏽🚩

The rules to be followed by the householder who has obtained Mantraksha..
💥 Put a new cloth in the pan and receive the matrakshat in it.
💥 Mantraksha should be tied in a cloth and kept in the room of God.
💥 All the members of the house should be clean, after everyone is clean, the master or the mistress of the house, any elder should bless each member of the house by putting two matrakshats on their heads.
💥 The rest of the matrakshat should be tied in a cloth and kept in God's room.

💥 Ta. On 22/01/2024 in Ayodhya on the day of Sri Rama Prana pratshapana if possible everyone should sit in one place and watch the event in Ayodhya.
💥 On the day of the installation, one should participate in a special pooja held in a temple and have darshan of the deity.
💥 On the evening of the inauguration day, every Hindu should light at least 5 or as many lamps as possible and celebrate Diwali festival.

💥 On the day of the installation of Shri Ramdev in Ayodhya, meat must be avoided in every Hindu's house.
💥 Make a night stew from the Mantrakshata left in the God's room, and everyone in the house should receive it in the form of Prasad..
💥 Every household should respect the Rama devotees who bring Shri Ramdev's matrakshat and invitation paper to your house.

In this way, every Hindu is requested to be united and united by following the rules
Thank you..🚩🚩🚩

30/12/23, 23:49 - Vinay Gowda: GOLDEN RULES

The most important point above all the practises you do.
It will bring health, long life, clarity and flow of your energy. It will increase your spiritual understanding and make you aware of your deeper realms and those of nature. It will clear all negativity and make you more alive. Any practises you do it will bring faster results and deeper intutive wisdom.

Golden rule

Breathe deep and long till your belly make it a conscious effort whole day. It is the japa , rhythm of the cosmos. It will stabalize your emotions and stresses. Gives you control over chattering mind. Pay attention to both inbreath and out breath equally long and deep, more you breathe out totally more you breathe in deeply. 

Breathe from whole body.

See your breath as movement of Shakti Durga if you are devotional bent. Feel it with devotion.
If not devotional just do breathing long.

Second rule
Whole day keep your spine straight don't  crouch. It disturbs flow of energy and creates mental disorders.
Straight spine facilitates  your energy movement through Chakras if you are doing any practise.

Many long living monks of hundred fifty years have this golden rule breathe long and deep till lower belly and always keep your spine straight.

These two things is like music. Spine is the instrument string held tight tuned straight so you can vibrate from base of the spine to top of the head.
Breath is the rhythm of energy flow, vibration of cosmos, which plays on your spine to give out music of your life actions and thoughts, which are in tune with the universal music.

Need I  say more? try it you will notice change a calmness, increase in power and wisdom which will go deeper and open your esoteric capacities.
Your intution the message of Durga will become clear.
 
Just this much can transform your life. 

Durga Devayae Namaha.
🙏🙏🙏

02/01/24, 22:26 - Vinay Gowda: Chant aum and dance everyday.
Aum is like white light Ram
Dancing is like rainbow Krishna.

These two things can nourish every aspect of life material and spiritual. It will energise your spiritual process and material journey.

It's like two ends of a bow of life and the stretch of the  rope in  the bow creates power in shooting arrows of action.

Your spine is the rope stretched between sky and earth, grace and gravity and you life is the manifestation of sound of aum dancing in your actions.

Keep spine straight and breathe in life to dance through you.

Cultivate integrated energy  through aum sound and make it dance so your both ends of bow are stretched. Then you are life itself sing like life, dance like life.

Hare Ram.

03/01/24, 16:35 - Meghanand: ರಾಮಾಯ ರಾಮಭದ್ರಾಯ ರಾಮಚಂದ್ರಾಯ ವೇಧಸೇ ।
ರಘುನಾಥಾಯ  ನಾಥಾಯ ಸೀತಾಯಾಃ ಪತಯೇ ನಮಃ ॥

ಇದು ಬಹು ಪ್ರಸಿದ್ಧವಾದ ಶ್ಲೋಕ. ಆದರೆ ಆ ಪದಪ್ರಯೋಗಗಳಿಗೆ ಇರುವ ಗೂಢಾರ್ಥ ಮನಸ್ಸಿಗೆ ಮುದವನ್ನುಂಟು ಮಾಡುವಂತಹುದು.

ಶ್ರೀರಾಮಚಂದ್ರನನ್ನು ದಶರಥ ಚಕ್ರವರ್ತಿ ಮಾತ್ರ 'ರಾಮಾ' ಎಂದು ಕರೆಯುತ್ತಿದ್ದನಂತೆ. ಆ ರೀತಿಯ ಅಧಿಕಾರ ತಂದೆಯಾದವನಿಗೆ ಮಾತ್ರ. 

ಇನ್ನು ತಾಯಿಯಾದ ಕೌಸಲ್ಯೆ ಮಗನನ್ನು 'ರಾಮಭದ್ರ' ಎನ್ನುತ್ತಿದ್ದಳಂತೆ. ಅದು ವಾತ್ಸಲ್ಯಭರಿತವಾದ ಸಂಬೋಧನೆ. 

ಚಿಕ್ಕಮ್ಮ ಕೈಕೇಯಿ ರಾಮಚಂದ್ರಾ ಎನ್ನುತ್ತಿದ್ದಳು. ಬಾಲ್ಯದಲ್ಲಿ ಬಾನಿನಲ್ಲಿರುವ ಚಂದ್ರ ಬೇಕೆಂದು ಅಳುತ್ತಿದ್ದ ಶ್ರೀರಾಮನಿಗೆ ಕೈಕೇಯಿ-ಮಂಥರೆಯರು ಕನ್ನಡಿಯೊಳಗೆ ಚಂದ್ರಬಿಂಬ ತೋರಿಸಿ ಸಮಾಧಾನಪಡಿಸಿದ್ದರು.! ಆ ಕಾರಣದಿಂದ ರಾಮಚಂದ್ರ ಎಂಬ ಅನ್ವರ್ಥನಾಮ. 

ಬ್ರಹ್ಮರ್ಷಿಗಳಾದ ವಶಿಷ್ಠರು ಶ್ರೀರಾಮನನ್ನು ಪರತತ್ತ್ವವೆಂದು ತಿಳಿದು 'ವೇಧಸೇ' ಎಂದು ಕರೆಯುತ್ತಿದ್ದರು. 

ಆದರೆ ಅಯೋಧ್ಯೆಯ ಪುರಜನರೆಲ್ಲಾ 'ನಮ್ಮ ರಘುವಂಶದ ಅರಸು' ಎಂಬರ್ಥದಲ್ಲಿ 'ರಘುನಾಥ' ಎಂದು ಕರೆಯುತ್ತಿದ್ದರು. 

ಇನ್ನು 'ನಾಥ' ಎಂದಷ್ಟೆ ಕರೆಯುತ್ತಿದ್ದವಳು ಸೀತಾದೇವಿ ಮಾತ್ರ.. ಹಾಗೆ ಕರೆಯುವುದು ಅವಳೊಬ್ಬಳ ಹಕ್ಕು.! ಯಾಕೆಂದರೆ ಶ್ರೀ ರಾಮ ಏಕ ಪತ್ನೀ ವೃತಸ್ಥ!

ಆದರೆ ಸೀತೆಯ ಊರಾದ ಮಿಥಿಲೆಯ ಜನರೆಲ್ಲರೂ 'ನಮ್ಮ ಸೀತೆಮಾತೆಯ ಗಂಡ' ಎಂಬ ಅಭಿಮಾನದಿಂದ 'ಸೀತಾಯ ಪತಯೇ' ಎನ್ನುತ್ತಿದ್ದರಂತೆ.
ಅಂತಹ ರಾಮನಿಗೆ ನಮಸ್ಕಾರ..!

Evening it will be around 2hrs
05/01/24, 14:44 - Vilas: 🙏
05/01/24, 15:23 - Vinay Gowda: Namaskaram,
I'm experiencing the energy body which has been interacting with me for 1 year. 

That's from the 2nd day of Linga Bhairavi Devi Sadhana Initiation (2023).

I didn't have any negative experiences till today, though.

But, I can feel that someone with a 99% transparent body (Energy Body/Sukshma Shareera) is moving around me and sometimes it also moves the objects around me.

Whenever they come near me I used to get goosebumps.

Here, I want someone who knows the occult sciences to answer this question.

*Is it okay to be like this and keep continuing my sadhana?*

Or else, 

*Do you want me to talk to that particular energy body through some practices of isha?*

FYI,
I'm lighting an oil lamp 🪔 every night and I also have a Linga Bhairavi Devi Gudi at home.

Recently performed pooja in front of Bhairavi Yantra in some other's home too.

I have also initiated into Shivanga Sadhana, Shiva Deeksha for 2 years and taken Shiva Maha-Mantra Deeksha at Sri Sarguru Sri Bramha Ashram, Yellanahalli, Ooty, Tamil Nadu.

Please bring this to an appropriate and concerned person.


Pranam,
Mahesh

05/01/24, 17:27 - Vilas: Omg, wts this!!
The Sadhana looks quite simple!
05/01/24, 17:38 - Vinod: What guideline should I need to give
05/01/24, 17:38 - Vinay Gowda: What is that energy body?
05/01/24, 17:45 - Vinod: Vinay please don't mind are u sure what he is explaining is valid
05/01/24, 17:46 - Vinay Gowda: Yes valid
05/01/24, 17:46 - Vinod: Because if u see his statement on the 2 day of initiation he felt that means
05/01/24, 17:46 - Vilas: Bro ask his experience once. 😛
05/01/24, 17:46 - Vinay Gowda: That means...
05/01/24, 17:48 - Vinod: See If he is in some sadana atleast for year I can explain u it might
05/01/24, 17:48 - Vinod: Be
05/01/24, 17:49 - Vinod: Because he is mentioning transparent body
05/01/24, 17:49 - Vinay Gowda: Why are you not considering his deeds of past lives
05/01/24, 17:49 - Vinod: In just a day
05/01/24, 17:50 - Vinod: Even shankaracharya underwent many year to witness shiva😅
05/01/24, 17:50 - Vinay Gowda: Some ppl clear upsc in 6 months and someone 6 years
05/01/24, 17:50 - Vinod: Seriously vinay I know what ever he explain it is possible
05/01/24, 17:50 - Vinod: I'm not say in it will not be but it need time
05/01/24, 17:51 - Vinod: Im thinking in other way that the place is so energized so he might felt that
05/01/24, 17:51 - Vinay Gowda: See you can cut time with focus, attention
05/01/24, 17:51 - Vinod: Vinay seriously 🙏🏻
05/01/24, 17:51 - Vinay Gowda: Wait i will send picture
05/01/24, 17:52 - Vinod: First of all as he mentioned anywhere while in meditative state I am experiencing the energy
05/01/24, 17:52 - Vinod: No he is directly went for naked eye
05/01/24, 17:53 - Vinay Gowda: Let me have an simple example

Student A takes 6 days to get ready for an exam

Student B takes 3 days to get ready for exam
05/01/24, 17:53 - Vinod: Stop this example🙏🏻pleae
05/01/24, 17:53 - Vinay Gowda: <Media omitted>
05/01/24, 17:53 - Vinod: Please
05/01/24, 17:54 - Vinay Gowda: I can give examples from puranas, vedas aswell
05/01/24, 17:54 - Vinod: Do u have any idea at what state he as to be so see the divine through naked eye
05/01/24, 17:54 - Vinod: Give me
05/01/24, 18:02 - Vinod: See I am not judging him or what ever he felt is not happened but to see divine form our body need to set to that state
05/01/24, 18:03 - Vinod: Like krishna gave divine vision to arjun
05/01/24, 18:03 - Vinod: But I can say with consistent effort this will be possible
05/01/24, 18:05 - Vinod: And firstly our sukshma shareera had to be that level to observe that then only physical
05/01/24, 18:05 - Vinod: Because divine will always be in different dimension than us
05/01/24, 19:01 - Vilas: <Media omitted>

07/01/24, 22:25 - Vilas: Day 27
07/01/24, 22:37 - Vilas: This Happened in 2017, I believe. #Sadhguru usually goes to a golf Ground early in the morning when he is in Ashram. However, on this particular day around 6:30 am I saw a National Geographic television crew's vehicle inside the premises. Shortly after, I alerted my team that Sadhguru had a Rally for Rivers Shoot event scheduled in Narasipuram village at 9 am. Then my team Swami and I followed Sadhguru.

Sadhguru drove his car very fast on the road to the village. Suddenly, he slammed on the brakes near Narasipuram. He put the car in reverse and we followed him. He turned into a farm, where an old man sat crying. Sadhguru approached the old man and asked for a tender coconut. He did not ask about the man's troubles. The old man gave Sadhguru the coconut. Sadhguru closed his eyes and held the coconut for a few seconds before returning it.

The old man said "No" but Sadhguru said "Drink first." After drinking the coconut water, the old man was filled with tears. He hugged Sadhguru and said "Swamy, Swamyyy, Swamyyyy." Sadhguru replied ( இந்த உயிர இந்த மாதிரி இனிப்பா வச்சிக்க முடியும் சாமி இல்ல கசப்பா வச்சிக்க முடியும்.. எல்லா நாம்ம உருகுவாக்னது தானே சரி பண்ணிக்கலாம்.. வாங்க) that you can make your life sweet or bitter - it is in your control. He also said that all things around us are our own making and we can fix them. Sadhguru then called for a swami to recommend support through Isha Farmer Producer Organizations (FPOs). After that, Sadhguru left the area & Reached event sharply. What a beautiful being Sadhguru is. 🙇‍♂️ 🙏
